This will get you a certifcate for one domain and one subdomain, e.g. *yourdomain.com* and *www.yourdomain.com*.

First, you'll need a server with an IP address, a domain name assigned to that IP address, **and a mail server** that you control. You need to be able to receive an e-mail at `postmaster@yourdomain.com`. You also need to choose an encryption password for one of the certificates.

Go to [www.startssl.com]() and start off by validating your e-mail address. Once you've done so, they will install a certificate in your browser that means you don't need to sign in with a password, just for a change.

Then you need to validate that you own the domain. To do that, they will send an e-mail to `postmaster@yourdomain.com` and you have to paste the code that you receive there back into startssl.com to prove you own the domain name.

Now you can get the certificate. Click on *Certificates Wizard*. The wizard will walk you through the process; 4096 bits and SHA2 are good choices to make. **Do not screw this up!!** The site has a single-page design, and is very, very slow to load anything, so it's extremely easy to click on the wrong thing while waiting for something to load. If you do this while waiting to receive the *ssl.crt* file, you may lose it. As far as I can tell (I may be wrong about this), you only get one chance to grab this key. If you miss it, you'll have to pay to have the certificate revoked before they'll generate a new one for you.

 At the end you should have the following files:

 * *ssl.key* (don't forget to decrypt this with `openssl rsa -in ssl.key -out ssl.key`)
 * *ssl.crt*
 * *ca.pem*
 * *sub.class1.server.ca.pem*

*ssl.key* and *ssl.cert* are unique to your site. *[ca.pem][]* and *[sub.class1.server.ca.pem][]* are not, and you can follow the links to download them.

See [Applying SSL keys to an Apache server]() for what to do next.
