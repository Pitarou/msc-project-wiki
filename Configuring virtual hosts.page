I want to give a sensible-looking url (e.g. `myproject.local`)
to a project I've created on my local apache server. How do I do it?

First, I need to tell the `hosts` file that `myproject.local` is
an alias for the local host `127.0.0.1` by adding this line to `/etc/hosts`:

    127.0.0.1 myproject.local

Then I need to tell the apache server how to map `myproject.local` to a folder
by adding these lines to `/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      DocumentRoot "/path/to/project/files"
      ServerName myproject.local
    </VirtualHost>

There's a lot more I can put in `httpd-vhosts.conf`,
but that's the bare minimum.

I can also configure a VirtualBox guest OS to access via a *host-only network*.
(I.e. a psuedo-network within the machine
that allows the host and guest OS's to talk to one another.)

To create the host-only network:

1. Launch the VirtualBox configuration app.
2. Select *VirtualBox > Preferences...* (or press *Command-,*)
3. Select the *Network* pane
4. Select *Host-only networks*
5. Click the *+* icon to add a Host-only network
6. Click on the screwdriver icon to see the network configuration details
7. Make a note of the IP4 Address (e.g. 192.168.56.1)

Now I can add this host-only network as a network adapter for any guest OS.
Then the IP4 address I got in step 7 will act like `127.0.0.1` for the host OS.
(There's probably more to it than that, but that does what I need.)
So if map `myproject.local` to `192.168.56.1` in the guest OS, by adding a line
to the hosts file like this:

    192.168.56.1 myproject.local

The URL `myproject.local` will be routed to 127.0.0.1 on the host OS.

Recent versions of Windows keep their `hosts` file at `Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
