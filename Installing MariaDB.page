Just installing it is a simple matter of:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install mariadb

but, as always, I want to go a little further and make it run as its own user.

Before we do anything else, let's set a password for the root account:

    $ mysql.server start
    $ mysql --user=root
    ...

    MariaDB [(none)]> set password = password('root account password');
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
    Bye

In future, when you want to run as root, it'll have to be like this:

    $ mysql --user=root --password

Now, [create a user](creating new users) called `_mysql`.

When Homebrew installed MariaDB it helpfully installed
all the necessary database files in `/usr/local/var/mysql`
so recursively `chown` that directory and everything in it to `_mysql`.

We also need a directory where the daemon can put its socket and pid file
as the user `_mysql`. I put it at `/private/var/run/mysql` set the owner
of the directory to `_mysql`.

Now we've got to tell the daemon and client where the socket and pid are.
To do that we need to find out where the configuration file is, which
we do with:

    $ mysqld --verbose --help | less

and it should tell you in the first few lines.  In this case, the file was at
`/usr/local/etc/my.cnf`.

In the configuration file, both client and server need to know where the socket is,
but only the server needs to know where the pid file is, so we write:

    [client-server]
    socket=/private/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

    [mysqld]
    pid-file=/private/var/run/mysql/mysql.pid

(In truth, the reason why I know that `socket` needs to go in the `client-server`
section and `pid-file` needs to go in the `mysqld` section is that I've tried
moving the declarations between sections, and this is the only arrangement that works.)
