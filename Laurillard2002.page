Introduction
============

Discusses the paradoxical hopes we have for our undergraduate students.
We want them to learn a great deal in a short time,
but we also want them to enquire, explore, and take a critical approach.
The truth is that, given limited student and teacher time,
and the demands of the curriculum,
the teacher has to take most of the responsibility
for what the students learn.

> This is the paradox that challenges the teaching profession:
> we want all our students to learn the same thing,
> yet we want each to make it their own.

Discusses the pressures faced by tutors, and their near impossible task,
and laments that we still know very little about what works in teaching.

> I see the solution as being found in a new organisational infrastructure,
> not in guidelines on how to teach. ...
> We may have only limited knowledge of how to teach well,
> but at least we can use a productive methodology that helps us build our knowledge.

Then goes on to discuss what the chapters contain:

> Chapter 4 leads us towards thinking about how to specify appropriate learning activities for students, which raises the question of how we might facilitate them.

> Part II begins by describing an analytical framework for classifying these media, the Conversational Framework.

> Chapters 5 to 9 define the different categories of learning media,
> though not from the point of view of their apparent characteristics,
> which is the standard approach of books on educational media.
> They are described instead in terms of the nature of the learning activities they support:
> narrative, interactive, adaptive, communicative, and productive. ...
> Describing the different media in terms of the Conversational Framework,
> allows us to develop a comparison of what they contribute to learning.

Chapter 1: Teaching as mediating learning
=========================================

> The aim of teaching is simple: it is to make student learning possible

Ramsden, Paul 1992. *Learning to Teach in Higher Education*. London: Routledge

> This strand of educational theory has always argued for
> the learner to be actively engaged in the formation
> of their ideas.  More recent exponents of the latter tradition
> are Vygotsky, Piaget, Bruner, Papert, all of whom argue
> for the active engagement of the learner
> rather than the passive reception of given knowledge.
> ... However, in universities, with their continued reliance
> on lectures and textbooks, the classical tradition of
> 'imparting knowledge' still flourishes in the forms

Examines the dialectic of 'formal knowledge' v. 'situated learning'.
*Precepts* v. *percepts*.

> The point about academic learning is that, being articulated,
> it is known through exposition, argument, interpretation.
> It is known through reflection on experience
> and represents therefore a second-order experience of the world.
> Knowledge derived from experiencing the world at one remove
> must be accessed differently from that known
> through a first-order experience.

Goes on to discuss the example of teaching the idea of a physical 'force'.

> We certainly use our everday experience
> to help interpret the meaning of the physics lecture,
> and to an extent it helps. ...
> The physics lecture cannot, however, offer any new experience

> Every academic subject faces the same kind of challenge,

Summary
-------

> The implications for the design of teaching are that:
>
>  *  academic learning must be situated in the domain
>     of the objective, and learning activities must
>     match that domain;
>
>  *  learning environments must be designed with features
>     that afford the learning of precepts, the affordances
>     for academic learning;
>
>  *  academic teaching must help students reflect on
>     their experience of the world in a way
>     that produces the intended way of representing it.

Chapter 2: What students bring to learning
==========================================

Discusses different approaches to investigating "learning styles".

 *  Some concentrate on fixed characteristics of the **learner**.

 *  Others concentrate on characteristics of how learners approach
    a particular **task** (contextualised, in other words).

> The remarkable conclusion from all these studies is that
> what students know can be described in a relatively concise way,
> as long as you penetrate to the level of
> what the concept means to the student.
> Brown and Van Lehn, in their study of subtraction procedures,
> found 89 different ways of doing it wrongly
> (Brown and Van Lehn, 1980).
> However, by going to a different level of description,
> at the level of understanding,
> Resnick and Omanson (1987) found just two ways
> of misconceptualising subtraction.
> Looking at procedures attacks the problem at the wrong level.
> If a student borrows across zero incorrectly,
> we want to teach him not 'how to borrow across zero',
> but what 'borrowing' means.
> Subtraction is not just the formal manipulation of a procedural skill.
> The skill is inseparable from the knowledge it invokes.
> The most commonly identified problem with the teaching of arithmetic
> is that it divorces the process of subtraction from its meaning in action,
> as Brown himself argued in his later work,
> already discussed in Chapter 1 (Brown *et al.*, 1989a).
> It makes no sense to remediate a faulty procedural skill with reference to the procedure alone;
> we have to appeal to the conceptual apparatus that supports it as well.
> We have already established that knowledge is situated in action.
> Similarly, action manifests knowledge;
> and 'buggy' behaviour manifests an underlying conceptualisation
> that itself needs remediation. ...
>
> Resnick and Omanson made use of the systematic definition
> of Brown and Van Lehn's 'buggy algorithms' (i.e. flawed procedures),
> but concluded that it is best not to remediate them,
> but to take them as revealing a fundamental flaw in the way children think about number
> in the context of these tasks.

Chapter 3: The complexity of coming to know
===========================================

This chapter explores the concept of *methagenic activities* (learning tasks).

It's hard to know what happens during learning activities.
If we ask them to think aloud, the point of insight is precisely
the moment when they shut up and start ruminating.
We can do better with retrospective interviews,
but we must be careful to treat the learner's account
as a phenomenon to be analysed in itself, rather than a true account.

Five different aspects are examined.

Apprehending Structure
----------------------

Reiteration of quote from introduction:

> a peculiarity of academic learning is to focus, not on the world itself, but on othersâ€™ views of that world.
> The idea that people can learn through listening to lectures
> most clearly expresses the fact that teaching is a rhetorical activity,
> seeking to persuade students of an alternative way of looking at the world they already know through experience. 

But first, students have to apprehend the structure of the ideas.
Like the famous girl / old woman ambiguous image,
the same information can be structured in different ways,
to give different meanings.

Here we encounter, time and again the problem of deep and shallow thinkers.
Deep thinkers miss the structure.
They ignore the interconnected nature of the topic, despite the fact that:

> The typically greater complexity of the academic conception
> makes it extremely important that students attend to the full scope
> of the discourse structure.

Many texts have a *principle--example* structure, but students often miss this,
and just see the text as a series of interesting examples.

Here's a diagram from [Booth1997](), which is a more elaborate version
of the one given in this text:

![Figure 1: Graphical illustration of structures imposed on a text about forms of learning, comprising descriptions of forms of learning and illustrative examples, with (a) coherent, integrated and (b) sequential understandings (Booth & Marton, 1996; after SÃ¤ljÃ¶, 1982).](/Booth1997 figure 1.png)

To reiterate:

 *  some students read this as a series of interesting studies of dogs and rats
 *  others get that it's about classical and instrumental conditioning

Similarly, students take deep and shallow approaches to learning activities.
Some just want to get the answer out and have done with it.

> without looking at the structure as a whole in relation to their task,
> the student will be unable to appreciate the meaning of the answer they have produced

We must somehow encourage students to:

> > Focus on â€˜what is signifiedâ€™ (e.g. authorâ€™s argument, or the concepts applicable to solving the problem). ...
> > Relate and distinguish evidence and argument. Organise and structure content into a coherent whole.
>
> --- (Ramsden, 1992:42)

Rather optimistic conclusion:

> Through understanding students' different approaches to structure and meaning
> we can design teaching to encourage the mathemagenic activities they need,
> summarised by the characteristics of a deep approach to apprehending structure.

Another thing this section mentions is that the *phenomenographic approach* is a good way
to understand what approach the students are taking.
I guess this is why [Stoodley2006](), [Bruce2006]() and (if I can ever got hold of it)
[Booth1992]() struck me as important.

Interpreting Forms of Representation
------------------------------------

Every discipline has its own forms of representation
(language, diagrams, notation, and so on).
There are limited studies on the effects of choice
of form of representation.

### Study 1: Supply--Demand Curves ###

Students were given simple straight-line supply and demand curves
with the usual properties that supply increases, and demand decreases, as the price rises.
There was a second supply curve that represented a tax rise.
Students were asked to infer the change in equilibrium price caused by the tax rise.
The correct answer was that prices would increase, but not by as much
as the tax rise.  They would rise to a level where demand has decreased
(because the price purchasers experience has risen) and supply has decreased
(because the price sellers experience after tax has fallen) by the same amount.

They were given three different representations:

 -  a Supply--Demand graph
 -  supply and demand equations
 -  tables of supply and demand figures

Students did much better with the graph,
because on the graph the intersections between the supply and demand curves were **salient**.
(It probably helped that the two supply curves never crossed.)

In the other forms, the need to equate supply and demand was not salient,
so the shallow thinkers just ignored it.

### Study 2: Representations of Crystal Structure ###

Apparently, there are various ways of representing the structure of a crystal.
In a course, learners were introduced to a widely-used, useful, but highly abstract
representation.

The shallow learners treated this diagram as a meaningless formalism,
and found the manipulations involved manageable, so they had no problems with it.

But the deep learners had great difficulty, because the mappings between the representations
were difficult. One student explained exactly where the problem lay:

> The only way I can learn something is to do it.
> Itâ€™s all done for us here and itâ€™s not fully educational for me.
> Instead of all these being drawn in, if these were exercises and we had to do work,
> then Iâ€™d get it straight away.

I.e. he needs to **practice mapping between the representations**.

Should we conclude from these that the teacher must always choose a representation
that makes the important features salient?  No.  We must encourage deep thinking.
But we can use these representations as an entry point:
we can encourage learners to practice mapping between the different representations,
and choose the one that is most useful for the task at hand.

Acting on the World (of Descriptions)
-------------------------------------

The author makes the point throughout the book
that academic knowledge is second-order knowledge.
We do not experience "evolution" in the same way we experience "dog".
We do not experience "electrical current" in quite the same way
as children playing with buckets in a stream experience "water current".

Many activities that appear to be learning directly about the world
(seeing a play, peering down a microscope)
are actually contextualised and, thus, mediated by the teacher.
Students spend most of their time acting on descriptions of the world
-- the mediated world -- rather than the world itself.

Using Feedback
--------------

Action without feedback is pointless.
Feedback can be *intrinsic* or *extrinsic*.

*Intrinsic feedback* is a natural consequence of the action itself:

 *  If you tip a bucket at a steeper angle, water flows faster.
 *  If you move the mouse, the pointer on the screen moves.
 *  If you mispronounce a word, people will correct you.

*Extrinsic feedback* is an external comment on the action.
Because academic learning is often at the level of description,
this is often the only kind of feedback that learners get.

> To use feedback, students must be able to make sense of it.
> The teacher has to devise situated actions
> that elicit meaningful intrinsic feedback for the student,
> or redescribe the studentâ€™s description
> in a way that gives meaningful extrinsic feedback to the student.

Reflecting on Goals--Action--Feedback
-------------------------------------

Phenomenographic research shows there is often a dichotomy between
teacher and student goals.
For instance, in one study, the teacher saw the goal as:

> a challenging logical problem in linking the features of the device
> to the capabilities of the microprocessor
> via the medium of a set of coherent and unambiguous instructions.

whereas the students saw it as:

> a problem in matching the demands of the teacher, as defined in the exercise,
> to the information available,
> as encoded in the linguistic and pictorial forms of representation he used in the lecture,
> via the medium of symbols and diagrams

This is important, because reflecting on task *in relation to its goal*
is known to be an important part of deep learning.
So it befalls the teacher to help form the students perceptions
of what is required, what is important, and what they should reflect on.

Summary
-------

We know empirically that in successful mathemagenic activities students should:

 *  understand the structure of the discourse --
    distinguish evidence from argument
 *  interpret (i.e. map between) the forms of representation --
    in particular, map between the parts of the discourse and the whole
 *  act on descriptions of the world --
    combine and manipulate the various representations
 *  use feedback, both intrinsic and extrinsic --
    adjust actions and descriptions to fit the goal
 *  reflect on the goal--action--feedback cycle --
    i.e. how the feedback from their actions relates to the structure of the whole

Chapter 4: Generating a teaching strategy
=========================================

This chapter covers a lot of theoretical ground from a very high level,
and I'm a little lost in places, because I'm not familiar enough with the theory.

Overview
--------

First, it discusses how little empirical knowledge
we really have about how context affects learning.

Then there is a critique of previous work on teaching strategies,
mostly in terms of the appropriateness of their empirical basis,
with the conclusion that phenomenography is the way forward.

Finally, building on the basis of the previous chapters,
it presents a high-level, phenomenography-based description
of what an effective teaching strategy should look like.

There is also a digression into "The myth of Socratic teaching",
in which Laurillard argues that, whatever it is, it isn't teaching.
The student contributes nothing, and need never even be aware of
the overall structure or goal of the activity.

Instructional Design
--------------------

Grandaddy of the field,
introduced by Robert GagnÃ© in his 1965 book *The Conditions of Learning*.

It proceeds from fairly logical, uncontroversial statements
to rather bland conclusions.
But Laurillard asserts that there is no real empirical basis.
In later editions, the authors cite empirical evidence from the field of cognitive psychology,
but Laurillard claims that the evidence is misapplied.
Research designed to gain insight into how the brain works,
is not the same as research designed to gain insight into teaching.

She concludes with:

> GagnÃ© and Merrill begin their paper with these words:
> 
> > One of the signal accomplishments of contemporary doctrine on the design of instruction ...
> > is the idea that design begins with the identification of the goals of learning.
> > 
> > --- (Ibid. 23)
> 
> This may seem rather obvious for an idea dignified as a 'signal accomplishment',
> but its complete absence from much educational planning
> shows that it was worth saying. ...
> A progressive force in educational design theory
> would be one that cumulatively builds our knowledge of the phenomena concerned,
> and this does not.
> I think we can do better.

Constructivist Psychology
-------------------------

Constructivism is an account of how the individual actively constructs knowledge
through their interaction with the world.
Unlike in the 'knowledge transmission' model of teaching,
the constructivist teacher manages these interactions
to support knowledge construction.

> This is the kind of analysis we need.

There's a lot in this section I don't understand.
But what I do get is:

1. Constructivism is a broad church,
   that includes at least two disparate schools of thought:
   the individual / cognitive (Piaget)
   and the socio-cultural (Vygotsky).

2. Laurillard finds the various constructivist prescriptions for teaching
   interesting, but wanting.  They are either not empirically based,
   too teacher centred, or too difficult to apply.

In conclusion:

> Martin and Booth argue that we have to transcend
> the person-world dualism assumed in both forms of constructivism,
> and accept that the world that we experience is constituted
> as an internal relation between the world and the learner.
> This brings us to the third type of approach to generating a teaching strategy.

Phenomenography
