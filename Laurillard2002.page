Introduction
============

Discusses the paradoxical hopes we have for our undergraduate students.
We want the to learn a great deal in a short time,
but we also want them to enquire, explore, and take a critical approach.
The truth is that, given limited student and teacher time,
and the demands of the curriculum,
the teacher has to take most of the responsibility
for what the students learn.

> This is the paradox that challenges the teaching profession:
> we want all our students to learn the same thing,
> yet we want each to make it their own.

Discusses the pressures faced by tutors, and their near impossible task,
and laments that we still know very little about what works in teaching.

> I see the solution as being found in a new organisational infrastructure,
> not in guidelines on how to teach. ...
> We may have only limited knowledge of how to teach well,
> but at least we can use a productive methodology that helps us build our knowledge.

Then goes on to discuss what the chapters contain:

> Chapter 4 leads us towards thinking about how to specify appropriate learning activities for students, which raises the question of how we might facilitate them.

> Part II begins by describing an analytical framework for classifying these media, the Conversational Framework.

> Chapters 5 to 9 define the different categories of learning media,
> though not from the point of view of their apparent characteristics,
> which is the standard approach of books on educational media.
> They are described instead in terms of the nature of the learning activities they support:
> narrative, interactive, adaptive, communicative, and productive. ...
> Describing the different media in terms of the Conversational Framework,
> allows us to develop a comparison of what they contribute to learning.

Chapter 1: Teaching as mediating learning
=========================================

> The aim of teaching is simple: it is to make student learning possible

Ramsden, Paul 1992. *Learning to Teach in Higher Education*. London: Routledge

> This strand of educational theory has always argued for
> the learner to be actively engaged in the formation
> of their ideas.  More recent exponents of the latter tradition
> are Vygotsky, Piaget, Bruner, Papert, all of whom argue
> for the active engagement of the learner
> rather than the passive reception of given knowledge.
> ... However, in universities, with their continued reliance
> on lectures and textbooks, the classical tradition of
> 'imparting knowledge' still flourishes in the forms
> through which we teach, if not in the rhetoric
> of individual academics.

Examines the dialectic of 'formal knowledge' v. 'situated learning'.
*Precepts* v. *percepts*.

> The point about academic learning is that, being articulated,
> it is known through exposition, argument, interpretation.
> It is known through reflection on experience
> and represents therefore a second-order experience of the world.
> Knowledge derived from experiencing the world at one remove
> must be accessed differently from that known
> through a first-order experience.

Goes on to discuss the example of teaching the idea of a physical 'force'.

> We certainly use our everday experience
> to help interpret the meaning of the physics lecture,
> and to an extent it helps. ...
> The physics lecture cannot, however, offer any new experience
> of the world to match this new idea. It offers only a
> different way of thinking about apples falling. ...
> Every academic subject faces the same kind of challenge,
> to help students go beyond their experience,
> to use it and reflect on it,
> and thereby change their perspective on it,
> and therefore change the way they experience the world.
> Academic knowledge is located in
> our experience of our experience
> of the world. Teaching may use the analogy of
> situated learning of the world, but must adapt it
> to the learning of descriptions of the world.
> I have termed this 'mediated learning' after Vygotsky.
> 
> > A scientific concept involves from the first
> > a 'mediated' attitude towards its object.
>
> --- (Vygotsky, 1962:102)
>
> Teaching as mediating learning involves
> constructing the environments which afford
> not only learning of the world,
> but also learning of descriptions of the world.
> The means of access to the two types of knowledge is different.
> The one is direct, the other mediated.

> Teaching is essentially a rhetorical activity,
> seeking to persuade students to change
> the way they experience the world
> through an understanding of the insights of others.
> It has to create the environment
> that enables students to embrace
> the twin poles of experiential and formal knowledge.


Summary
-------

> The implications for the design of teaching are that:
>
>  *  academic learning must be situated in the domain
>     of the objective, and learning activities must
>     match that domain;
>
>  *  learning environments must be designed with features
>     that afford the learning of precepts, the affordances
>     for academic learning;
>
>  *  academic teaching must help students reflect on
>     their experience of the world in a way
>     that produces the intended way of representing it.

Chapter 2: What students bring to learning
==========================================

Discusses different approaches to investigating "learning styles".

 *  Some concentrate on fixed characteristics of the **learner**.

 *  Others concentrate on characteristics of how learners approach
    a particular **task** (contextualised, in other words).

> The remarkable conclusion from all these studies is that
> what students know can be described in a relatively concise way,
> as long as you penetrate to the level of
> what the concept means to the student.
> Brown and Van Lehn, in their study of subtraction procedures,
> found 89 different ways of doing it wrongly
> (Brown and Van Lehn, 1980).
> However, by going to a different level of description,
> at the level of understanding,
> Resnick and Omanson (1987) found just two ways
> of misconceptualising subtraction.
> Looking at procedures attacks the problem at the wrong level.
> If a student borrows across zero incorrectly,
> we want to teach him not 'how to borrow across zero',
> but what 'borrowing' means.
> Subtraction is not just the formal manipulation of a procedural skill.
> The skill is inseparable from the knowledge it invokes.
> The most commonly identified problem with the teaching of arithmetic
> is that it divorces the process of subtraction from its meaning in action,
> as Brown himself argued in his later work,
> already discussed in Chapter 1 (Brown *et al.*, 1989a).
> It makes no sense to remediate a faulty procedural skill with reference to the procedure alone;
> we have to appeal to the conceptual apparatus that supports it as well.
> We have already established that knowledge is situated in action.
> Similarly, action manifests knowledge;
> and 'buggy' behaviour manifests an underlying conceptualisation
> that itself needs remediation. ...
>
> Resnick and Omanson made use of the systematic definition
> of Brown and Van Lehn's 'buggy algorithms' (i.e. flawed procedures),
> but concluded that it is best not to remediate them,
> but to take them as revealing a fundamental flaw in the way children think about number
> in the context of these tasks.
