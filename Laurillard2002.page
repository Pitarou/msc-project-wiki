Introduction
============

Discusses the paradoxical hopes we have for our undergraduate students.
We want the to learn a great deal in a short time,
but we also want them to enquire, explore, and take a critical approach.
The truth is that, given limited student and teacher time,
and the demands of the curriculum,
the teacher has to take most of the responsibility
for what the students learn.

> This is the paradox that challenges the teaching profession:
> we want all our students to learn the same thing,
> yet we want each to make it their own.

Discusses the pressures faced by tutors, and their near impossible task,
and laments that we still know very little about what works in teaching.

> I see the solution as being found in a new organisational infrastructure,
> not in guidelines on how to teach. ...
> We may have only limited knowledge of how to teach well,
> but at least we can use a productive methodology that helps us build our knowledge.

Then goes on to discuss what the chapters contain:

> Chapter 4 leads us towards thinking about how to specify appropriate learning activities for students, which raises the question of how we might facilitate them.

> Part II begins by describing an analytical framework for classifying these media, the Conversational Framework.

> Chapters 5 to 9 define the different categories of learning media,
> though not from the point of view of their apparent characteristics,
> which is the standard approach of books on educational media.
> They are described instead in terms of the nature of the learning activities they support:
> narrative, interactive, adaptive, communicative, and productive. ...
> Describing the different media in terms of the Conversational Framework,
> allows us to develop a comparison of what they contribute to learning.

Chapter 1: Teaching as mediating learning
=========================================

> The aim of teaching is simple: it is to make student learning possible

Ramsden, Paul 1992. *Learning to Teach in Higher Education*. London: Routledge

> This strand of educational theory has always argued for
> the learner to be actively engaged in the formation
> of their ideas.  More recent exponents of the latter tradition
> are Vygotsky, Piaget, Bruner, Papert, all of whom argue

> rather than the passive reception of given knowledge.
> ... However, in universities, with their continued reliance

> 'imparting knowledge' still flourishes in the forms
> in the forms through which we teach, if not in the rhetoric
> of individual academics.
