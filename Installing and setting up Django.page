Install Python 3
================

This is a new project, and Python 3 is now well supported,
so it seems appropriate to use Python 3.

    brew install python3

added Python 3.3.3 to my system.

I can launch Python 3 with the command `python3`, and the Python 3 package manager with `pip3`.

Install and configure `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`
==========================================================

    pip install virtualenvwrapper

I used pip, rather than pip3, because Python 2 is the default Python for my system.  `virtualenv` will run under Python 2, but it has no problem creating a Python 3 environment.

Create a directory for my virtual environments and associated projects, and tell `virtualenvwrapper` about them:

    mkdir ~/Python
    mkdir ~/VirtualEnvironments
    mkdir ~/Projects

And add this to `~/.bash_profile`:

    # tell virtualenv I want to use python3, rather than the default python installation
    export VIRTUALENV_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3

    # tell virtualenvwrapper which directories I want to use
    export WORKON_HOME=~/Python/VirtualEnvironments
    export PROJECT_HOME=~/Python/Projects

    # make virtualenvwrapper load lazily
    export VIRUALENVWRAPPER_SCRIPT=/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy.sh

(Lazy loading means that tab completion for `virtualenvwrapper` commands
will only work after I've run a command once.)

Create a Python 3 Django environment
====================================

Since I've set the `VIRTUALENV_PYTHON` variable to point at Python 3,
pip3 and Python 3 will be used by default.

    mkvirtualenv django
    workon django

Now I'm in an environment where `python` is bound to Python 3.
Install Django in this environment:

    pip install django

Now I can enter that environment with the `workon django` command.

Create a project
================

Create a duplicate of the django environment for the project. Enter that environment:

    cpvirtualenv django project_name
    workon project_name

Create the django project:

    cd ~/Python/Projects
    djangoadmin.py startproject project_name

Bind the project to the environment:

    cd project_name
    setvirtualenvproject

(Any number of virtual environments can refer to the same project. This means we can unit-test a project in mutliple environments.)

Now `cdproject`, `cdsitepackages` and `cdvirtualenv` will take me to the relevant directories.

To leave the virtual environment, say `deactivate`.
