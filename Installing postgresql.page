It seems that Django, Heroku and postgresql are a good combination,
so I need to install postresql on my system.

Used homebrew to get it:

    homebrew install postgresql

And to make it automatically start when I start my system:

    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
