Overview
========

Bringing non-pedagogial perspectives on technology adoption to the implementation of VLEs.

Useful Quotes

Technology Acceptance
=====================

Looks at the factors influencing how an individual responds to new technology.
The grand unified model has the following important factors:

Performance expectancy
:   Will it help me?  Will it make me look good?
Effort efficiency
:   Is it easy to use?
Social influence
:   Am I expected to use it?  Who else is using it?
Facilitating conditions
:   Will I be supported to use this?
    
These factors drive *behavioural intention* and *use behaviour*.
Factors that influence this conversion include gender, age, experience,
and voluntariness of use.

Another model mentions computer self-efficacy (*am I good with computers?*).

Diffusion of Innovation
=======================

Process-based model of how an organisation responds to a new technology.
The stages are:

 1. **Knowledge**

    How you learn about it may influence your attitude at later stages.

 2. **Persuasion**

    What factors influence you to try adopting it?

    relative advantage
    :   is it better than what we already have?
    compatibility
    :   **not** technical compatibility: compatibility with needs, values, etc.
    complexity
    :   
    trialability
    :   
    observability
    :   can others see the results of adopting it?

 3. **Decision**

    Can be:

    optional
    :   you can use it if you want
    collective
    :   we're all going to use this
    authority
    :   boss says we have to use this

    Generally, the greater the degree of participation in the decision-making
    process, the greater the degree of adoption.

 4. **Implementation**

 5. **Confirmation**

An alternative model:

 1. **Initiation**

    agenda-setting
    :   identify the **performance gap**
    matching
    :   tailor the innovation to solve the organizational problem and eliminate
        the performance gap

 2. Implementation

    redefining / restructuring
    :   rejig the innovation to better match the
        organization's needs
    clarifying
    :   the meaning of the innovation becomes clear as people start
        using it
    routinizing
    :   the innovation becomes an everyday fact of life
        within the organisation

The performance gap is important.  Without the perceived gap between what
the organisation expects of itself and what it is actually achieving, there
won't be much interest.

A Learning Process
==================

The emphasis is on the *communities of practice* model. The key message is that we should
design our systems for *community participation*.

Knowledge is produced and held collectively, in communities of practice.  This community gives
its members a sense of identity, and members will perceive new technology in terms of
its perceived effects on *community participation*.

Communities require *boundary objects* which help them coordinate with other communities.
The VLE can function as a boundary object.

At this point, the paper is too condensed for me to make sense of.  I need to read the
referenced paper to really get what it's talking about.  But here's what it says:

> Wenger (1998), drawing on a discussion with the sociologist, Leigh Star,
> identifies four characteristics which enable artefacts to act as boundary objects:
> modularity, abstraction, accommodation and standardization.
> Modularity implies that the VLE should offer different users different views of the system.
> Abstraction is accomplished by distinguishing certain important features
> of described concepts in the system.
> Accommodation is realized in the VLE by comprising different functions
> to support different activities
> (e.g., chat, discussion groups, streaming video, sound, etc).
> Standardized forms of communication are necessary, so that each member of a community knows how to deal with it.
> The characteristic of standardization, therefore, implies that functions and information in the VLE
> should be organized in the same way in all the courses of the university

A VLE should:

 * support interaction within communities of practice (e.g. course forums)
 * support informal communication between communities
 * allow for information *reach*
 * support *reciprocity* (i.e. it should support the *peripheral participation*
   of less knowledgeable newcomers as they learn - e.g. forum lurkers,
   or teachers observing their peers)
