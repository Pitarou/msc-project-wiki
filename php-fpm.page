# Getting started with php-fpm

php-fpm is already installed on Mac OS X Mavericks,
but it is not configured.

When launched, it looks for a configuration file in
`private/etc/php-fpm.conf`, but that file is not installed.
But there is a heavily annotated `private/etc/php-fpm.conf.default`
to get me started.

The compiled-in default prefix for the configuration files and so on
is `/usr/var`, which isn't part of the default file tree for OS X.

I ended up tweaking the settings as follows:

  * save the pid at `/private/tmp/php-fpm.pid`
  * write to the error log at `/private/var/log/php-fpm.log`

That's enough to get it up and running.
Next step is to get it running as a proper background process with its own user ID.
