# Getting started with php-fpm

php-fpm is already installed on Mac OS X Mavericks,
but it is not configured.

When launched, it looks for a configuration file in
`private/etc/php-fpm.conf`, but that file is not installed.
But there is a heavily annotated `private/etc/php-fpm.conf.default`
to get me started.

The compiled-in default prefix for the configuration files and so on
is `/usr/var`, which isn't part of the default file tree for OS X.

I ended up tweaking the settings as follows:

  * save the pid at `/private/tmp/php-fpm.pid`
  * write to the error log at `/private/var/log/php-fpm.log`

That's enough to get it up and running.

# Launch on startup

Here's the plist file at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.php-fpm.plist`:

~~~ {.xml}
<?xml version="1.0" coding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>/local.php-fpm</string>
  <key>Program</key>
  <string>/usr/sbin/php-fpm</string>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>

A problem has become apparent with one application.
I'm accessing php-fpm through an nginx proxy bound to
port 8080, but the links in the Moodle website mostly
look like this: `http://moodle.local/course/view.php?id=2`.
No 8080!

I was inclined to assume that the problem was somewhere in my
configuration, but grepping phpinfo() for '80' shows

    _SERVER["SERVER_PORT"]   8080

and so on, with no references to port 80.
Looks like Moodle has a slight problem there.

In any case, now that php-fpm is working, I can stop using Apache
and move nginx to port 80, so that should fix it.
