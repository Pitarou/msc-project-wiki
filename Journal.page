Time concerns
-------------

Reading Projects in Computing and Information Systems to try and get an
idea of what I’m up against. It’s a **lot** of work! Far more than just
producing and documenting the artifact. How much of what I’m reading
about will be needed for this project?

Reflections on sample projects
------------------------------

Finished reading (or, sometimes, skimming) the six sample project
reports that I found browsing various past final project course websites
on StudyNet. Some of them are scarily impressive - especially the one
about using smartphones to monitor for road congestion and potholes and
warn drivers. On the other hand, I was reassured by a more modest one
about developing usability heuristics for mobile apps: I think I could
manage something like that.

Project ideas: Moodle
---------------------

I’m very interested in turning my project into a contribution to Moodle.
(A mature, open-source, php-based Virtual Learning Environment.) This is
partly because I’m aware that I need to build some kind of portfolio of
open-source work if I’m going to be taken seriously as a developer in
future, and a contribution to Moodle fits the bill nicely.

I introduced myself on the Moodle Developers’ Forum, and asked for
suggestions for projects. [The response](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=228290) was impressive: rapid, warm,
and carefully considered. I got some general advice about doing an MSc
project from someone who has recently done the same thing, and some
really good suggestions. The main suggestions, and my thoughts on them,
were:

1.  A facility to embed self-assessment questions in other material
    (implemented as a “Moodle filter”)

    Sounds great, if it’s not too technically ambitious.

2.  Some kind of forum-monitoring utility.

    Doesn’t sound too technically challenging. If I can get a group of
    Moodle users involved, this one could really come to life. However,
    there might be problems gaining ethical approval for what could be
    viewed as a surveillance system.

3.  A pointer to material about language learning and literacy.

    Interesting, but I foresee real problems if I try to tie my
    coursework into my day job. I lack grounding in the relevant
    pedagogical theory, so I could get bogged down in the literature
    review, and it might be impossible to get permission to involve my
    students.

4.  Usability and user interaction studies for Moodle on a mobile
    platform.

    Very good suggestion - this is an area that is often neglected in
    FOSS projects, and academia can make an important contribution. But
    I’m not sure I could manage the logistics of setting up a usability
    study here in Japan. (Not to mention the problems with translating
    ethical approval forms.)

In any case, I’ll mention all of these to my project supervisor when the
time comes.

Narrowing down project ideas
----------------------------

The course has now opened on StudyNet, so I have access to a lot more
material. It’s now clear that my coursework will probably have to
include a significant software development component (unless I can make
a very strong case otherwise), so that probably prevents the Usability
and Interaction idea.d

So that leaves me with the embedded self-assessment questions and the
forum monitoring.

Scope
-----

Earlier, I was concerned about projects that were too ambitious in
scope. But the materials I’m encountering now are warning me the other
way: don’t attempt something that is unambitious and can’t be extended.
But, to be honest, I’ve never been short of grandiose plans to expand
the scope, and the fields I’m looking at are not exactly constrictive.

More feedback on Moodle project ideas
-------------------------------------

I got some more feedback on the embedded-question idea. Tim Hunt (the
guy who did a lot of work on Moodle’s question engine) says that if I
implement it as a Moodle filter then it shouldn’t be too difficult. The
hard part will be stopping students from taking advantage of this system
to peek at questions they shouldn’t.

In view of what I wrote about scope earlier, this opens up an
interesting possibility. Essentially, there are two projects in this
idea. The core project is to implement the filter. This is enough to be
of pedagogical interest. The additional project is to implement a system
to control question visibility. This is of technical interest and, if
done well, it’s likely to be of use to implementors of other
pedagogically interesting features such as granting students the ability
to write and share self-assessment questions.

Evaluation and ethics
---------------------

This might be problematic for the two projects I’ve mentioned, because
an ideal evaluation would involve a Moodle installation that’s in active
use, and I fear I won’t be able to get ethical approval. The dashboard
idea **might** be easier, because I could limit my contact to the tutors
who use the dashboard, but I’m not sure whether the ethics committee
would accept that. More research is required.

I definitely need to discuss this with someone, because it might turn
both Moodle ideas into a non-starter. This can’t be the first time that
someone’s encountered this problem with e-learning technology projects.

Project ideas
-------------

ATutor: similar to Moodle, although perhaps less mature and with a
smaller community. It has a strong emphasis on accessibility.

Improving accessibility for Moodle?

Mahara (mahara.org) is an open-source, php-based “personal learning
environment” that allows students to create and share portfolios of
work. I heard about it because it integrates with Moodle.

What else is there? I need to do some research.

The problem of pedagogical research questions
---------------------------------------------

After further reflection, I think the evaluation and ethics problems I
discussed above boil down to this: an e-Learning Technology project
seems to demand a **pedagogical research question**, which strongly
implies that, when I come to evaluate my work, I will have to measure
its **impact on real students**. And that creates all kinds of
headaches.

Clarification from course leader
--------------------------------

I posted a summary of my concerns on the discussion forum, and got the
following response from Dr. Schilstra:

> My view is that the programme is called e-Learning *Technology*, and I
> would therefore concentrate on the technical/engineering aspects. Your
> research questions may - and probably should - include the pedagogical

Which begs the question…

What exactly is a “proper requirements analysis”?

2013-05-16
==========

Project ideas
-------------

A programming question type (perhaps for Moodle). Students have to write
or debug code to meet a given spec. The answer is scored by running it
against a battery of unit tests.

A basic implementation would use Javascript. A more ambitious one might
use other languages on the backend.

(*Anything* would be better than the dreadful Java exam I was subjected
to in my *Introduction to Programming* module.)

[Virtual Programming Lab for Moodle](http://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/en/iwhat-is-vpl) allows users to submit files to be
compiled, run and evaluated.

Running in the client would be nice, if I can find a suitably sandboxed
interpreter.

I once saw a nice ASM simulator in browser javascript.

[www.brython.info](http://www.brython.info) looks interesting, but it’s poorly documented.

Or maybe something that uses Knuth’s MIX?

Bingo! <http://jterrace.github.io/js.js/>

> js.js is a JavaScript interpreter (which runs in JavaScript) that
> allows an application to execute a third-party script inside a
> completely isolated, sandboxed environment.

Overall plan:

1.  Create a proof-of-principle using a textbox and Javascript eval.

2.  Add a pretty code editor.

3.  Replace eval with js.js (gives us sandboxing and error message
    control

Then **either**:

1.  Then add at least one other interpreter.

2.  Then try switching to a client-server AJAX model.

**OR**:

1.  Announce a coding contest and recruit lots of enthusiastic testers!
    :-)

Moodle programming question idea
--------------------------------

Pedagogically speaking, it strikes me that it’s important for objective
tests of programming ability to be realistic about how people actually
do their programming work. They don’t sit in hermetically sealed rooms
and write their code on scraps of paper. They use all the technical and
information resources available to them including:

-   books

-   manuals

-   search engines

-   code examples

-   code libraries (either their own, or libraries supplied by others)

-   information from discussion fora

-   code completion features in their editor

-   compiler error messages

-   debugging tools and techniques

So we have to ask ourselves, what (combinations of) restrictions can we
impose, and what restrictions should we impose?

-   Does the student use a computer?

-   Is it his own computer, or supplied?

-   Can he bring other materials?

-   What can he access on-line?

-   What kind of code editors does he use?

-   Are we interested only in whether the problem is solved correctly,
    or are we concerned about matters like code efficiency, or the
    ability to find an good (but not necessarily optimal) solution in a
    limited period of time?

-   Can we trust the student not to manipulate the machine he’s working
    on to produce false results?

Gathering requirements
----------------------

I’m reading about requirements gathering. It’s clearly a huge area that
I know very little about. I’m a little concerned that I might let my
project down with a poor set of requirements, but I don’t recall seeing
much about requirement gathering in the example project reports I’ve
read.

I’m starting with the first two chapters of:

Withall, S., 2007. *Software Requirement Patterns* - Chapter 1 Expanded.
In Software Requirement Patterns. Microsoft Press. Available at:
<http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/companion/9780735623989/>.

Project ideas
-------------

It’s high time for me to actually pick something. To be honest, I
haven’t given the matter nearly enough consideration, but that’s to be
expected when you bear in mind that I’m also trying to complete the Web
Scripting and Content Creation coursework that I should have finished
last year.

I’ve written a document summarising my thoughts on the matter and posted
it to the course discussion forum. Here it is:

Reading Paper Prototyping
-------------------------

While I’m waiting for more feedback on my ideas, I’m delving into the
reading list.

I’m currently reading Paper Prototyping by Carolyn Snyder. The
discussion about the students who prototyped a touch screen interface
for a car music system (pages 42-45) was interesting.

Useful quote next time somebody tells me that I can just use a fake
Moodle site for the dashboard idea:

> Don’t forget the data. As Chapter 7 explains, if you plan to conduct
> usability tests of your design, users will need to see realistic data
> to perform meaningful tasks.

Snyder, C., 2003, *Paper Prototyping: The Fast and Easy Way to Design
and Refine User Interfaces*, Morgan Kaufmann, p. 55

Page 67:

> Usability testing tests our assumptions, and uncovers hidden
> assumptions.
>
> Paper prototyping is a form of usability testing that:
>
> -   is fast and cheap
>
> -   identifies problems before they’re coded
>
> -   elicits better feedback from users - the visibly unfinished nature
>     of the design gives the users freedom to make broad-reaching
>     suggestions, rather than nit-picking
>
I’ll need to read Chapter 12: *What Paper Prototyping is (and isn’t)
Good* For to better justify my decisions in my report.

Where can I get removable tape from?

Book that might be worth checking out: Weiss, S. 2002. *Handheld
usability*. New York: John Wiley & Sons

Good example of a consent form at
<http://www.paperprototyping.com/downloads/Fig8.1_informed_cnsnt.pdf>

“Incredibly intelligent help” is an interesting approach. There is a
human “help system” available, and the user can ask questions. The help
system does not volunteer information: it only gives terse answers,
based on what the user actually asked.

P. 123

Another project idea: moving the VLE out of the VLE
---------------------------------------------------

This is still very vague, but here goes:

Why do we have these Virtual Learning Environments that are sealed off
from the rest of the internet? Why not construct a learning environment
from the materials around us: Facebook, Wikia, Tumblr, StackExchange,
YouTube, and so on? Investigate how to deliver a course in a completely
open environment.

This idea emerged from conversation with Tokusei Noborio, one of my
English for Special Purposes students. It’s certainly intriguing, but I
couldn’t do it except in a partnership. Running a course is a lot of
effort!

Proposal
--------

Yet again, working on the project proposal is really helping me hone my
ideas. And just a little nibbling round the edges of the literature has
already given me a lot to think about.

My general approach is turning out to be:

-   Research the field so that I know what I’m trying to build, and why
    I’m trying to build it.

-   Build the simplest thing that could possibly work.

-   Abstract the hell out of it, until (in its final form … although I
    doubt I’ll get that far) there’s nothing but a core protocol through
    which a collection of plug-ins can talk.

Sharing on GitHub
-----------------

The course tutor appears not to have had any problem with me showing my
project proposal on the forum but, after some remarks from another
student, she warned us against the risks of sharing code anywhere except
the course forum. (Presumably because any discussions can be observed.)

That’s unfortunate. I think my project’s natural home is on GitHub, and
I’m eager to put an interesting portfolio there. I’ve put a note on the
course forum making a case for sharing my work on GitHub: GitHub is all
about attribution (History and Blame buttons on every code listing) so
if there’s anywhere I can make my code visible without the suggestion of
plagiarism or collusion, it’s GitHub.

Feedback from Moodle developers forum
-------------------------------------

Tim Hunt got back to me on my ideas. He described a neat solution for
the security problem of the question filter idea. So neat, in fact, that
the scope of the problem is now too small for a PhD. Just hash the
question number with some secret salt. Moodle generates the hash when
the question is being posted, but only if the poster has sufficient
authorization. Moodle checks the hash when the question is being viewed.

Luckily, he likes the programming question idea. Although he also
cautions about its complexity, and the security problems. I told him I
would start a new thread on the Moodle forum when I’ve finished my
proposal.

He also pointed out previous similar work: a Junit question type.
Thanks, Tim!

<http://docs.moodle.org/19/en/Junit_question_type>

Need to research for my proposal
--------------------------------

There are a few obvious gaps in my proposal that can, and should, be
plugged by a little research. They are:

-   What is the value of automated objective programming tests?

-   Look into the Quiz / Question plug-in architecture.

-   Look into writing questions that live on other servers. (Common
    sense tells me that it’s possible, and I believe that Tony
    Medwin-Gardner’s first implementation of confidence based marking
    for Moodle used this approach, so it makes sense at least some of
    the time.)

Two more questions I need to consider:

-   What about evaluation?

-   What about getting some clients on board?

Once those questions have been taken care of, I think I’ll have a good
proposal.

Sandboxing
----------

When I was answering Tim Hunt, it occurred to me that my project will be
of limited value unless I implement server-side checking. And that means
I need sandboxing. The problem is, I have no experience with sandboxing.
I’m going to have to put in some serious effort into improving my server
admin skills, including how to set up a sandbox for running untrusted
code.

More feedback from Moodle developers
------------------------------------

I’ve received many more interesting replies. In particular, a few people
have pointed out similar projects that I was not aware of:

<https://github.com/trampgeek/CodeRunner>

At first glance, this appears to be another fully fledged Moodle
question type with server-side sandboxing and user testing.

<https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack>

This is an algebra rather than a programming question type, but it
solves a very similar problem, so I can learn something from its
architecture.

Proposal status
---------------

The proposal isn’t finished yet, but I’m happy with what I have. Still
to-do:

-   Find references for a pedagogical justification for a programming
    question type

-   Discuss why both client-side and server-side are important,
    preferably with references.

Check, and find citations for the following statements:

-   A Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) is a Content Management System
    for online and mixed-mode courses.

-   Question types are implemented as modules that conform to an API
    defined in the quiz module.

-   It is even possible to implement questions that are hosted on
    another server?

-   The Read Eval Print Loop is considered a valuable development tool
    in many programming languages.

-   Find examples of server-side interactive consoles (i.e. terminal
    emulators embedded in the browser)

-   Find examples of other Intelligent Tutoring Systems and other VLEs
    that might benefit from this tool.

-   Add link to the Moodle Forum proposal discussion in the
    acknowledgments

Things I would like to do:

-   Make sure my Mendeley database is in sync with the reference list
    for my proposal.

-   Port the document to . This will already have some advantages
    (keeping track of the section and cross-reference numbering is a
    pain), and it’s a good time to learn.

This journal
------------

It turns out that Google Drive isn’t quite the ideal tool for keeping a
journal. I’ve noticed three issues:

-   the UI is noticeably slowing at startup

-   I am now of the opinion that verifiable time-stamping is important

-   although I can view Google Drive documents offline on my Android
    tablet, I can’t edit them offline, and the on-line editing
    functionality is missing features that I am using in this journal

I’m on the lookout for an alternative.

Project Proposal
----------------

It’s done. I’ve submitted it. [I also posted it to the forum.](http://www.studynet2.herts.ac.uk/ptl/Students375.nsf/Files/676473C158F5AED480257B7E001934FA/$FILE/PP_McarthurPeter.pdf) As one
might expect, the process of filling in the gaps (in particular, finding
appropriate citations) forced me to go and actually look at the
literature, and I learned a lot from the process.

This journal
------------

I’ve just finished porting this journal to Emacs org-mode. One
especially nice feature of org-mode is that I can integrate to-do lists
into my journal.

Here is my sysadmin todo list:

Timestamping commits
--------------------

Someone else has been thinking about this problem, and has found a
solution. GitHub already adds cryptographic fingerprints to maintain
archive integrity. So all I need to do is submit those fingerprints for
timestamping.

ouDetailed instructions on StackOverflow: [How can I use RFC3161
(trusted) timestamps to prove the age of commits in my Git
repository?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11913228/how-can-i-use-rfc3161-trusted-timestamps-to-prove-the-age-of-commits-in-my-git)

(In principle, it’s possible to add these timestamps to your Git
repository with [Git notes](http://git-scm.com/2010/08/25/notes.html).)

This is overkill. Nobody’s going to question GitHub’s timestamps, and
for the journal, I just need to zip it, timestamp the archive, and send
it to dropbox.

Playing with tech: why doesn’t bibtex work for org-mode?
--------------------------------------------------------

I’ve spent far longer than is sensible trying to “optimise my tools for
my productivity workflow”. (I.e. playing with emacs, org-mode, and
LaTeX.)

Well, you never know, it might even pay off. Some people have even
written entire theses in org-mode. At some point, I’m going to move all
my reading notes into a separate file (or would it make more sense to
use org tags?), but for now I’ll just keep throwing them into this
journal.

Right now, I’m trying to figure out why reftex can see my .bib files,
but the pdf compiler (MikTeX, presumably?) can’t. Browsing the help
forums tells me that adding bibtex to my compiler toolchain by
configuring the variable org-latex-to-pdf-process or
org-latex-pdf-process (depending on which source you consult) should do
the trick, but I haven’t found any magical incantation that’s worked
yet.

I did find this at
[orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.html](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.html):

> Note that makeindex and bibtex require a bit more effort to work in

[Babel](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html) is a special mode that allows you to execute snippets of code
from within the file (and do things with the stdout output, but the
point here is that an environment variable is being exported).

I think I understand what I have to do, but I’m too tired to start it
now.

Burnout: taking things easy
---------------------------

I’m starting to burn out. This should come as no surprise, given how
busy I’ve been. Unfortunately, I still have a busy week ahead, so I’m
going to have to limit myself to only urgent matters for a few days,
while I give myself a chance to recover.

For instance, I haven’t written notes on any of the papers I’ve read
recently. Those notes are just going to have to wait until I’m feeling
stronger.

And, given the deadline looming at the end of this month, I’m going to
have to devote most of my available energy to my other project. So this
project is going to be pretty quiet for a few weeks.

He sent me three replies in quick succession. He told me a lot about
himself, and his background. I’d expected him to be a young post-doc, or
similar, so I was quite suprised to learn that he was a retired
professor (and a good deal else besides).

The main thrust of his advice was: KEEP THINGS SIMPLE. This reflects my
worries about this project, but it’s good to be reminded. *Vigilance is
the eternal price of simplicity. as Abe Lincoln might have said if he’d
ghost-written for Douglas Cockburn.*

I wrote to him again:

He told me to come up with my own metrics. He also said:

Amen to that.

Long absence
------------

It’s been a long time since I did anything useful on this project. In
the end, I paid a heavy toll for my burnout: I had to take a couple of
days off work, and I haven’t been able to get back into my study
routines again for a long time.

Proposal feedback
-----------------

Remarkably little has happened on the course. I received the following
feedback on my project proposal:

Meeting
-------

An on-line Skype meeting with my supervisor, and his other two supervisees, is scheduled for Saturday.

More tech
---------

I’ve bought a new computer for doing my project. It’s a sleek and shiny
MacBook Air -- heavenly!

After a lot of experimentation, I think I've come up with a way to keep my
notes that I'm reasonably happy with.  I'm using a wiki platform called _gitit_.  I like it because:

 * It's Haskell. I still love Haskell, even though I haven't used it in years.

 * It's built around PanDoc, so I can freely mix, match and convert document formats in
   whatever way suits me.

 * It's also built around Git, so all I have to do is put it on Github and my verifiable
   history problems are solved.

 * Although I'll miss the WYSIWYM goodness of LyX, in practice it does very little that I
   can't do just as well with Markdown.  And if I want to do anything fancy, it's easy enough
   to convert to LaTeX.

PanDoc also has an experimental BibTeX extension, so I'll see if I can integrate that.  If so, I might be able to do all of my work in this wiki.  It's a shame there isn't a *blog* extension.  If I have the time, I might be able to do something about that.

Citations in gitit
------------------

As far as I can tell, gitit already supports citations in principle.  It should be a straightforward matter, in principle, to add a link to the `.bib` file as metadata.  Unfortunately, it's not supported, but I still have access to the underlying PanDoc tools so I can probably come up with something.

Transfer to github
------------------

Excellent!  I now have this wiki synced to github. All I have to do is say the magic words:

    git push -u origin master

and the two are in sync.  I'm automating this with launchd.  [Keeping the gitit wikis on the mac and on github in sync]().

2013-07-15
==========

Converting from Pandoc to LaTeX
-------------------------------

I've experimented a little, and it kind of works, but there's still a lot I have to figure out:

 * The title, author, date Pandoc metadata is not being used.
 * The bibliography links aren't working (which is to be expected, because I haven't told it where to look for the .bibtex file)
 * Setting up the appropriate template

I reckon it's worth figuring out how to set up the appropriate toolchain, because then I can potentially compose the whole document in this wiki.
