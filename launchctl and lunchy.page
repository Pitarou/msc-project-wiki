# launchctl

`launchctl` is nice, but a little perplexing at times. Here's what I've gleaned so far:

* `launchctl` looks in three 5 places:

   - At boot time:

     - `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`
     - `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`

   - At login time:

     - `/Library/LaunchAgents`
     - `~/Library/LaunchAgents`

* If the .plist is in the `~/Library/` path, it is launched as the logging in user.
  Otherwise it is run as root, or as the user specified by the `Username` key of the .plist.

* The root-level .plists can only be launched as root.

* **Agents can be enabled and disabled** by a setting in the file `/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchdb/overrides.plist`.

* If you're getting a 'nothing found to load' error message, it's probably disabled.
  Try calling `launchctl -F load /path/to/plist` to force it to load.
  Or `-F -w` if you want it to record this change in the `overrides` plist mentioned above.

* If you get a `no plist returned` error, it's probably a malformed plist. Try `plutil -lint`.

# lunchy

`lunchy` is a nice frontend to `launchctl`. Just type `lunchy` at the command line to get documentation. Its best feature is that you can just type a substring of the job's name (e.g. `sudo lunchy restart nginx`) and it'll figure out what you mean.
