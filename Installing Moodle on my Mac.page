Configuring Apache and PHP
==========================

Apache and PHP are already installed in OS X Snow Leopard.
The apache user is `_www` in the `staff` group.

I looked for the `php.ini` file with the command:

~~~ {.bash}
php -i | grep php.ini
~~~

which told me that it would be in `/etc`.
There wasn't a file at `/etc/php.ini`,
but there was a file at `/etc/php.ini.default`.

I checked that these default settings matched the requirements listed at
<http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/PHP>.  They did **but** I still need to
check where temp files are being uploaded.

The Mac OS X convention is to put user's websites in `~/Sites`,
so I created the directory `/Users/peter/Sites`.

I placed the following apache directive at
`/etc/apache2/users/peter.conf`:

~~~ {.xml}
<Directory "/Users/peter/Sites/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews
    AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
~~~

(I'm not sure about whether the `AllowOverride` line is what I want.
Different HOWTOs give different settings, and I've no idea what it does.)

I uncommented the line

    LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

in the file `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf`.

Then I created a file at
`/Users/peter/Sites/phpinfo.php`
with the immortal line:
~~~ {.php}
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
~~~

I launched apache with:

~~~ {.bash}
sudo apachectl start
~~~

I could then see the results of the `phpinfo` command
by pointing my web browser at <http://localhost/~peter/phpinfo.php>.
I checked that these matched the requirements at
<http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/PHP>.
They did, although the recommended module `intl` is **not** installed.

MySQL
=====

I used the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager
to install MySQL.

I can launch SQL with:

~~~ {.bash}
mysql.server start
~~~

If I want to launch mysql automatically at startup,
I can use the following command to add a file that `launchd` will see:

~~~ {.bash}
ln -s /usr/local/opt/mysql/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
~~~

Here are the contents of the `.plist` file:

~~~ {.xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>KeepAlive</key>
  <true/>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>homebrew.mxcl.mysql</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe</string>
    <string>--bind-address=127.0.0.1</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
  <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
  <string>/usr/local/var</string>
</dict>
</plist>
~~~

I can create a similar plist file to launch apache.

Next, I have to tell php how to connect to mysql,
because php looks in the wrong place.

~~~ {.php}
cd /var
mkdir mysql
cd mysql
ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock .
~~~

Finally, I should use the command `mysql_secure_installation`
to fix some of the commonest security holes.

Database administration
=======================

Set up the appropriate database and user with:

~~~ {.bash}
mysql -u root # add a -p switch if root has a password
mysql> CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,DROP,INDEX,ALTER
    -> ON moodle.* TO moodleuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '';
mysql> quit;
~~~

Here, the `TO moodleuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ''` creates a user account with an empty password.

There's a free Mac application called Sequel Pro
that serves as a nice UI for administering a MySQL database.
Unfortunately, the download link lead to a 404 page,
but I found an alternative source via the blog,
with a modicum of URL hacking: <http://sequel-pro.googlecode.com/files/sequel-pro-1.0.2.dmg>.

Or I can use phpMyAdmin.

Installing phpMyAdmin
=====================

Download and unpack the files into a web directory.
(The directory was called `phpMyAdmin-4.0.4.1-english`,
which is a bit of a mouthful, so I changed it to `phpMyAdmin`.)

Create a sub-directory `phpMyAdmin/config` and set its permissions:

~~~ {.bash}
chmod o+wr config
~~~

Now visit `phpMyAdmin/setup` with your browser, and enter information about your database.

Save.

A file should be created in the config directory.

~~ {.bash}
mv config/config.inc.php .
chmod o-rw config.inc.php
rm -rf config
~~

And now you can log in at phpMyAdmin directory.

For security purposes, I should delete the `phpAdmin/setup` directory.

Creating Virtual Hosts
======================

Not got this far yet....

Uncomment the line:

    Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

in

    /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

Here's an example entry in `/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`:

~~~ {.xml}
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/Users/Jason/Documents/workspace/dev"
  ServerName jason.local
  ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/jason.local-error_log"
  CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/jason.local-access_log" common

  <Directory "Users/jason/Documents/workspace/dev">
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
~~~

We also have to add the line `127.0.0.1	jason.local`
to `/etc/hosts` and flush the Directory Service cache
with `dscacheutil -flushcache`.
