Interesting Quotes
==================

Stuffed full of quotes about what kind of approach to design the authors favour.
E.g.:

> If a software architecture is sufficiently flexible
> to allow many possible ways of structuring the environment and the learning activities,
> then a more relevant question is not what the system can do,
> but what the educational practitioner wants to do with it. 

Summary
=======

Follow up to a report published in 1999.
Notes the more widespread deployment of VLEs,
and the moves to integrate them with other campus IT systems to create what they call
*Managed Learning Environments* (MLEs), but laments the lack of pedagogical innovation.

Like in the 1999 report, the framework's aim is:

> to assist practitioners in evaluating and selecting a VLE

but the new version can also:

> be used as a tool to help lecturers and institutional managers
> design effective learning environments and learning activities
> from a set of components. 

The framework is based on two models:

[The Viable System Model]() (VSM)
:   a multi-level view of a course
    as a system of intelligent agents,
    with various forms of oversight and management,
    that adapts and manages complexity.

[The Conversational Framework]()
:   a model of the dynamic feedback between tutors and students.
    **This seems especially relevant to my work.**

As VLE installations have become more sophisticated, so musr the criteria to assess them.
This is why the updated version of the framework drills a little deeper into the VSM.

The framework is presented a series of questions posed at the level of the module,
the student, and the programme. There aren't questions about individual activities,
but I may be able to take inspiration from their approach in devising my own
evaluation questions about the activity I'm designing.

In part 3, the questions are asked of several VLEs, including Moodle and LAMS
(Learning Activity Management System).
