There's a lot to wrap my brain round,
but I found a good looking guide [here](http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/long-firewall.html)
and the essentials about redirection
[here](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/rdr.html).
As far as I can tell, the rule to redirect
outbound connections to `10.10.10.10:80` to `127.0.0.1:8080` is something like:

    rdr on lo0 proto tcp from any to 10.10.10.10 port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080

lo0 is the [loopback interface ](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Setup.if).

10.10.10.10 is safe to use on private networks.

Once I've figured out the right rule, I think I can load it with:

    sudo pfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf
