There's a lot to wrap my brain round,
but I found a good looking gude at
[home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/long-firewall.html]()
and the essentials about redirection at
[www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/rdr.html]().
As far as I can tell, the following rule would redirect
outbound connections to `10.10.10.10:80` to `127.0.0.1:8080`:

    pass out on t10 from 127.0.0.1 to 10.10.10.10 port 80 rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 8080 keep state

but I'm really not clear about this. In particular, I've no idea what the `on t10` bit is.
(Curiously, when I copy--paste it, it turns into `on t|0`. Weird)
I also need to figure out how to actually load the rules!
