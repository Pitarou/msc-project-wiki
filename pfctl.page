There's a lot to wrap my brain round,
but I found a good looking guide [here](http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/long-firewall.html)
and the essentials about redirection
[here](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/rdr.html).
Still couldn't make sense of it, thought.
But I finally found instructions simple enough to follow
[here](https://gist.github.com/kujohn/7209628).

I added the following line to `/etc/pf.conf`:

    rdr on lo0 proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.2 port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080

And it worked. lo0 is the [loopback interface ](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Setup.if).
I think the rest is comprehensible.

I wasted a lot of time using the address `10.10.10.10` earlier but,
for some reason, it didn't work. Maybe because `10.10.10.10` doesn't match
the loopback interface?

I also have to put this line in the right place in the file. If I don't, I get an error like this:

> Rules must be in order: options, normalization, queueing, translation, filtering

And there must be a newline at the end of the file, otherwise I get a syntax error.

Finally, I can start the packet filter (`pf`) and load the file with this line:

    sudo pfctl -e -f /etc/pf.conf

`-e` = enable
`-f` = file

I can automate this with a suitable plist at `/Library/LaunchDaemons/local.pf.plist`.

But it's better if I can put my customisations in another file somewhere, and that's where anchors come in.
Anchors are more than just simple includes. They are points in the ruleset where you can go back and
add further rules later. But I'll just use them like simple includes for now.

So I amended `pf.conf` as follows:

    rdr-anchor nginx
    rdr-anchor gitit

    # ...

    load anchor nginx from "/Users/peter/.pf/nginx.conf"
    load anchor gitit from "/Users/peter/.pf/nginx.conf"

And, after fixing the syntax errors, it worked.
