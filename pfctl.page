There's a lot to wrap my brain round,
but I found a good looking guide [here](http://home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/long-firewall.html)
and the essentials about redirection
[here](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/rdr.html).
Still couldn't make sense of it, thought.
But I finally found instructions simple enough to follow
[here](https://gist.github.com/kujohn/7209628).

I added the following line to `/etc/pf.conf`:

    rdr on lo0 proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.2 port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080

And it worked. lo0 is the [loopback interface ](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Setup.if).
I think the rest is comprehensible.

(I wasted a lot of time using the address `10.10.10.10` earlier but,
for some reason, it didn't work. Maybe because `10.10.10.10` doesn't match
the loopback interface?)

I also have to put this line in the right place in the file. If I don't, I get an error like this:

> Rules must be in order: options, normalization, queueing, translation, filtering

And there must be a newline at the end of the file, otherwise I get a syntax error.

Finally, I can start the packet filter (`pf`) and load the file with this line:

    sudo pfctl -e -f /etc/pf.conf

`-e` = enable
`-f` = file

I can automate this with a suitable plist at `/Library/LaunchDaemons/local.pf.plist`.

But it's better if I can put my customisations in another file somewhere.
The standard `pf.conf` file is just all placeholders,
so I put my own `pf.conf` file in `~/.pf/pf.conf` and then use that as the argument
to `pfctl`.

Anchors are more than just simple includes. They are points in the ruleset where you can go back and
~~add further rules~~ replace the rules later. But here's how to use them like includes:

    # rdr-anchor means it will only include the rdr rules here

    rdr-anchor nginx
    rdr-anchor gitit

    # ...

    load anchor nginx from "/Users/peter/.pf/nginx.conf"
    load anchor gitit from "/Users/peter/.pf/nginx.conf"

If you want to reset the packet filter, you must call:

    sudo pfctl -F

To find the current rules, call:

    sudo pfctl -s all

or maybe:

    sudo pfctl -s nat

And finally, I just found good book on-line called
[Absolute OpenBSD: UNIX for the Practical Paranoid][] which
seems to tell me much of what I need.
Why didn't I find this earlier?  :^(
