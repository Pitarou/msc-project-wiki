There's a lot to wrap my brain round,
but I found a good looking gude at
[home.nuug.no/~peter/pf/en/long-firewall.html]()
and the essentials about redirection at
[www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/rdr.html]().
As far as I can tell, the rule to redirect
outbound connections to `10.10.10.10:80` to `127.0.0.1:8080` is something like:

    pass out from 127.0.0.1 to 10.10.10.10 port 80 rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 8080 keep state

but that generates a syntax error.

Once I've figured out the right rule, I think I can load it with:

    sudo pfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf
