> to address the needs of a client;
> the client could be 'real' or 'fictitious'.

Provide references for your development and evaluation methodologies.


Main objectives
---------------

**N.B. I misunderstood the purpose of this section in my project proposal,
so pay attention here!**

Example from p.59 of Dawson 2005:

Aim
:   Develop and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network to predict stock market indices

Objectives
:   * Complete a literature search and review
    * Develop a suitable Artificial Neural Network model
    * Identify and collect suitable data for analyses and evaluation
    * Evaluate the model using appropriate statistical techniques
    * Complete final report

Note that **system requirements are not project objectives**.

Also need a **project plan** here.

Hardware and software requirements
----------------------------------

Discuss what you need, and make sure it's available.

Discussion of need for Ethics Approval
--------------------------------------

Either explain why it doesn't need an ethics approval,
or briefly describe the study you intend to conduct.

Note that I need to design my instrument **before** applying for ethics approval.
