# Installing and launching

    $ brew install nginx

Read the caveats.

    $ nginx
    $ open http://localhost:8080

And up pops the 'Welcome to nginx!' page.

Easy!  Thanks, Homebrew people.  :-D

However, I did get a few caveats...

# Caveats (notes that appeared when I installed)

  * Docroot is: `/usr/local/var/www`

  * The default port has been set in `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

  * To have launchd start nginx at login:

         ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

    Then to load nginx now:

         launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:

        nginx

And here's the default *nginx.conf* file (with all the commented out lines removed):

    
~~~
worker_processes  1;
events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    server {
        listen       8080;
        server_name  localhost;
        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   html;
        }
    }
}
~~~

Now, here's the thing.
The 'Welcome to nginx!' homepage is at `/usr/local/var/www/index.html`.
(To be sure, I tried renaming the file and reloading in the web browser.)
The configuration file references `index.html`.
But where's the `/usr/local/var/www` bit?
I tried `env | grep www` and it didn't turn up there.
