# Installing and launching

    $ brew install nginx

Read the caveats.

    $ nginx
    $ open http://localhost:8080

And up pops the 'Welcome to nginx!' page.

Easy!  Thanks, Homebrew people.  :-D

However, I did get a few caveats...

# Caveats (notes that appeared when I installed)

  * Docroot is: `/usr/local/var/www`

  * The default port has been set in `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

  * To have launchd start nginx at login:

         ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

    Then to load nginx now:

         launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:

        nginx

# Running on port 80

After I'd stopped apache, I got it to run on port 80 by:

 * symlinking from `/Library/LaunchAgents` to the nginx.plist file mentioned above
 * setting the owner of **both** sides of the symlink to by root (`chown -h` changes the owner of the symlink)
 * putting port 80 in the config files

But this caused problems (see [#Running-as-_www]()) so I reverted it to port 8080 (see [#Running-on-port-8080]()).

~~~UPDATE: It turns out that it's possible to use `launchd` to launch files as root even if they .plist
is in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` (with the tilde). I think you have to do some combination of
chowning the .plist to root, add `<key>Username</key><string>root</string>` to the plist,
and call `sudo launchctl start -w /path/to/.plist`. (Or use `lunchy` instead of `launchctl`.)~~~

# Default `nginx.conf`

All the commented out lines are removed:
    
~~~
worker_processes  1;
events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    server {
        listen       8080;
        server_name  localhost;
        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   html;
        }
    }
}
~~~

Now, here's the thing: where is the docroot set?

The 'Welcome to nginx!' homepage is served from `/usr/local/var/www/index.html`
(to be sure, I tried renaming the file and reloading in the web browser)
but the configuration file references `index.html`.
I tried `env | grep www` and it didn't turn up there.

# Reverse proxying

This is what I installed nginx for:
because it's the recommended webserver for Django apps
(along with [gunicorn]()).

So what do I need to get it working?

Here's the "just to get you started" example in the
[gunicorn docs](http://gunicorn.org/index.html#deployment):

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name example.org;
      access_log  /var/log/nginx/example.log;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
    }

Here's a much more involved example, from
[gunicorn's fuller docs](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/deploy.html):

    worker_processes 1;
    
    user nobody nogroup;
    pid /tmp/nginx.pid;
    error_log /tmp/nginx.error.log;
    
    events {
        worker_connections 1024;
        accept_mutex off;
    }
    
    http {
        include mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;
        access_log /tmp/nginx.access.log combined;
        sendfile on;
    
        upstream app_server {
            server unix:/tmp/gunicorn.sock fail_timeout=0;
            # For a TCP configuration:
            # server 192.168.0.7:8000 fail_timeout=0;
        }
    
        server {
            listen 80 default;
            client_max_body_size 4G;
            server_name _;
    
            keepalive_timeout 5;
    
            # path for static files
            root /path/to/app/current/public;
    
            location / {
                # checks for static file, if not found proxy to app
                try_files $uri @proxy_to_app;
            }
    
            location @proxy_to_app {
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_redirect off;
    
                proxy_pass   http://app_server;
            }
    
            error_page 500 502 503 504 /500.html;
            location = /500.html {
                root /path/to/app/current/public;
            }
        }
    }

And here's an even fuller one, referenced from the gunicorn docs,
hosted at [github](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/examples/nginx.conf):

Food for thought....

# Current configuration

So now I have an `nginx.conf` installed at the default location
(`/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) which sets up a few basic things,
as laid out in the length example configuration file above,
and then includes configuration files for:

a Django project using gunicorn
:   configuration in the project's `nginx_conf` directory
this wiki
:   `~/.nginx/gitit.conf`
some php projects
:   `~/.nginx/php.conf`

    These all use `php-fpm`, so they all include
    `~/.nginx/php-fpm.conf`

# php-fpm headaches

The setup for `php-fpm.conf` is quite complicated,
because (in a pointless attempt to follow best practice)
I am trying to set it up in a way that is theoretically secure.
But php is inherently insecure, and Moodle takes advantage of a certain
php feature which is known to be a security headache.
The problem is with urls like
[http://moodle.local/theme/image.php/standard/core/1374664819/moodlelogo]().
Notice that there is a path specification **after** the `.php` file.
Very useful, I'm sure, but it means that if you can upload a file called `avatar.gif`
to `example.com/my_account/avatar.gif` and then you navigate to
`example.com/my_account/avatar.gif/blah.php` then, with a bit of luck,
the contents of `avatar.gif` get executed as a php script. Oops.

Anyway, on the basis of info at:

 * [http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Install_Moodle_On_Ubuntu_with_Nginx/PHP-fpm]()
 * [http://wiki.nginx.org/PHPFcgiExample]()

I have a setup that seems to work.
I still don't really understand what's going on, but the important bits are:

    location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) { .... }

Notice that this allows `.php` to be in the middle of the url.

Check for dodgy urls:

    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+?\.php)(/.*)$;
    if (!-f $document_root$fastcgi_script_name) {
        return 404;
    }

Pass on the extra path info to the server:

    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    fastcgi_param PATH_TRANSLATE $document_root$fastcgi_path_info;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;

# Running as `_www`

OS X won't allow just any process to bind to port 80,
so I have to run nginx as root.
But, of course, it would be much better to run as use `_www`.

This is self-evidently possible with apache,
but I was having trouble making that happen with nginx.
According to [Apple's documentation][]:

> `launchd` ... [e]liminates the primary reason for running daemons as root.
> Because `launchd` runs as root, it can create low-numbered TCP/IP listen sockets
> and hand them off to the daemon.

but I couldn't find any mechanism to make that happen.
I asked [on Stack Exchange][], and was told that I was barking up the wrong tree.
The webserver has to be written to request the socket, and nginx isn't.
So my choices are either:

 * Use [pfctl]() to forward requests from port 80 to port 8080, and have nginx listen to 8080.

 * Let the nginx master process run as root.
   (I can set the uid of the worker processes with the `user` directive in `nginx.conf`.)

[Apple's documentation]: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html
[on Stack Exchange]: http://superuser.com/questions/726906/

# Running on port 8080

The above works great except for one small issue: the webserver tells the code generating the web pages that it's running on 127.0.0.1:8080, and so the links are sometimes linked to port 8080.

So I lie to `fast-cgi` in `nginx.conf`:

    fastcgi_param SERVER_ADDR 127.0.0.2;
    fastcgi_param SERVER_PORT 80;

# Communicating on UNIX sockets

It's straightforward.  Just add a directive like `server unix:/var/php-fpm/php5-fpm.sock fail_timeout=0;`
Of course, the socket needs to exist, and nginx needs appropriate permissions.

# Files in the Dropbox folder

For some weird reason, nginx can't read a configuration file in my Dropbox folder.
('permission denied', no matter what I do with `chmod` or `chown`)
So I've moved the relevant `.conf` and `socket` files to `~/.nginx/sasanqua`.

And not just configuration files, as it turns out. I've also moved the static files
to `~/.nginx/sasanqua/static`, and placed a symlink at `~/Projects/Python/sasanqua/collect_static`.
