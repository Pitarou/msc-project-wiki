# Installing and launching

    $ brew install nginx

Read the caveats.

    $ nginx
    $ open http://localhost:8080

And up pops the 'Welcome to nginx!' page.

Easy!  Thanks, Homebrew people.  :-D

However, I did get a few warning messages.

# Caveats (notes that appeared when I installed)

  * Docroot is: `/usr/local/var/www`

  * The default port has been set in [/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf](file:///usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf] to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

  * To have launchd start nginx at login:

         ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

    Then to load nginx now:

         launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:

        nginx

# Simple configuration example
