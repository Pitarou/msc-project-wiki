Summary
=======

Students were interviewed, in an attempt to discern how they perceive the act of learning to program.

At one extreme, there were students who were only interested in getting the marks and passing the course.
Their horizon was the institution of learning.

At the other extreme, there were students who wanted to become professional programmers,
and everything that implies.

How can we get students to broaden their horizons?

Method
======

Used phenomonographic approach and *constitutionalist learning theory* (never heard that concept before ... think it'll come up a lot) to address the question: *What are the different ways in which foundation year students go about learning to program?*

Interviewed 13 first year Bachelor of IT students with varying backgrounds:

 *  *How do you see your current ability to program?*
 *  *What makes you say that?*
 *  *How do you decide?*
 *  *Do you enjoy programming?*
 *  *How do you got about learning to program?*
 *  (for those who have learnt to program in the past) *Can you describe how you want about learning to program when you first started?*
 *  *Can you write a program that works?*
 *  *How do you know?*
 *  *Can you write a good program?*
 *  *How do you know?*

Examined their answers looking for different ways to understanding
the act of learning to program, and an overarching structure.

Also looked at what was the students' focus (*internal perceptual
horizon*) and what was the concept in which they perceived themselves
to be operating (*external perceptual horizons*).

The interviewer was **not** a programming teacher:
this may (or may not) have helped eliminate the effect of institutional orthodoxies.

Results
=======

From their answers, students' ways of experiencing could be grouped into five categories,
ordered from narrowest to broadest perceptual horizons:

Category 1: 'Following'
-----------------------

Aim
:   get the marks, pass the course
Learning approach
:   keep up with the tasks, get feedback to ensure they're on track
How they see programming and programs
:   what they must do to get through the course
How they see learning the language
:   unclear
Internal horizon
:   tasks, feedback, course structure
External horizon
:   the institution


Category 2: 'Coding'
--------------------

Aim
:   learn the language
Learning approach
:   seek examples, seek expert guidance, wrestle with the compiler
How they see programming and programs
:   the ability to use the syntax and vocabulary fluently
How they see learning the language
:   pactice the syntax and vocabulary
Internal horizon
:   the computer, the task, and the syntax
External horizon
:   the language

Category 3: 'Understanding and Integrating'
-------------------------------------------

Aim
:   understand, internalise, progress, gain enlightenment
Learning approach
:   build conceptual understanding;
    experiment with varied approaches
How they see programming and programs
:   expressing concepts through syntax;
    applying concepts in new contexts;
    applying broad principles
How they see learning the language
:   learning the structure and logic of the language
Internal horizon
:   the task and the concepts;
    they see the task as a means of exercising the concepts
External horizon
:   universal principles and techniques of programming

Category 4: 'Problem solving'
-----------------------------

Aim
:   learn new ways to solve new kinds of problems
Learning approach
:   seek interesting tasks, consider, plan, create solution
How they see programming and programs
:   creating solutions to problems
How they see learning the language
:   a means to an end
Internal horizon
:   the task, and the concepts;
    they see the concepts as a means to solving the problem
External horizon
:   principles and concepts of programming;
    repertoire of prior experience
Category 5: 'Participating' or 'Enculturation'
----------------------------------------------

Aim
:   to become a programmer
Learning approach
:   develop conceptual and problem-solving skills;
    communicate with other programmers;
How they see programming and programs
:   tools; concpts expressed through syntax;
    cultural artefacts; means of communication
How they see learning the language
:   entry point into the world of programming;
    want to understand the context of usage as well as the language
Internal horizon
:   tasks; concepts;
    students an idea of what a programmer should be
External horizon
:   the programming community

Conclusions
===========

The authors make it clear that they will **not** make any claims
about the superiority of one approach to learning over another.
No link has been established between learning mode and performance,
and in any case, the outcome would be highly dependent on the mode of assessment.

(Although the authors go on to partially contradict themselves.)

They address five questions:

What are the critical ways in which we want students to experience learning to program?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teachers can design activities to encourage students
to act in certain modes.
We might want students to focus on category 2 earlier in the course,
when they need to get those building blocks in place,
and then expand their horizons as the course progresses.

What are the implications, for students, of certain ways of experiencing the act of learning to program?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Students who stay in Categories 1 or 2
may not achieve the deeper learning
necessary for success later in the course.

How can curriculum support ways of going about learning?
--------------------------------------------------------

In Categories 1 and 2, students focus on the parts rather than the whole.

Category 1 students want discrete, manageable chunks,
and continual feedback. They prefer frequent, small assessments
so they know when they're on track.

Category 2 students can be encouraged to understand that
coding is part of the bigger picture of
programming, problem solving, and professional practice.

Category 3 students will experience greater satisfaction
if the course is structured and presented in such a way
that the student can clearly see how each concept
builds on previous ones.

Category 3 and 4 students expect support
in their development of understanding.
Visual aids (diagrams, animations and so on) can help,
and teachers can explore non-visual forms too.

They might prefer assignments based on modules,
in which they build upon previous work.

Category 4 students will appreciate material presented
in a way where the application to problem solving is highlighted.
This may require emphasis on breaking a problem down into smaller parts,
and solving the sub-problems, so the students can see the value
of everything they do.

They will be more motivated in their assignments
if they have some choice in the problems they are trying to solve.

Category 5 students will want networking opportunities.
Even beginners might appreciate contextualisation in
'real world' settings.

How can we help students move to more sophisticated ways of learning?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If we want Category N students,
we must expose them to Category N experiences.

How can we further use the outcomes to help our students learn?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: it has been shown that, at least in some exams,
students who learn by rote do better than students who demonstrate insight.
So perhaps increasing pass levels is not our only concern.

[Or maybe we should look for better modes of assessment?
Need to get hold of [Booth1997]()!]
