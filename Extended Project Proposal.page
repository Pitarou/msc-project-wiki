\section{Research Question}

\emph{How can pedagogical principals be applied to the use of software
unit tests in learning activities in a Virtual Learning Environment?}


\section{Objectives}


\subsection{Core}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Review literature and prepare a report on the pedagogical principles
and evaluation of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item learning activities in Virtual Learning Environments
\item systems for automated assessment of computer code written by students
\end{enumerate}
\item Develop pedagogical requirements for a learning activity using software
unit tests in a Virtual Learning Environment. Divide these requirements
into a minimal core and advanced requirements.
\item Implement and deploy a plugin for the Moodle Virtual Learning environment
to meet the core requirements.
\item Evaluate the module using the criteria and methods identified in the
literature review.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extend the plugin to meet some of the advanced requirements. For example,
the plugin might support peer review, or meta-assessment (see Section
\ref{sub:Automated-Objective-Tests}).
\item Invite domain experts to evaluate the system. Collate their findings
into a report.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}


\subsection{\label{sub:Automated-Objective-Tests}Automated Objective Tests of
Computer Programming Proficiency}

Manually grading programming assignments can be labour intensive and
unreliable. Consequently, tutors set fewer assignments than they think
desirable, and tend to concentrate on the visible aspects of the source
code, such as maintainability, over the invisible aspects, such as
correctness and performance. \citep{Cheang2003}

Since the 1960s, computer science educators have sought to mitigate
this problem by using the computer itself to assess code correctness
and performance, using what are now called software unit tests. Early
systems were highly specialised, bespoke systems. As the technology
improved these systems became:
\begin{itemize}
\item easier to use
\item more generic and easier to adapt
\item available for use on personal computers, or through the internet
\end{itemize}
Notable pedagogical developments have included support for:
\begin{itemize}
\item sharing and peer review of code
\item requiring the students to write their own unit tests for assessing
their code, and automatically assessing the quality of the unit tests
(or \emph{meta-assessment})
\end{itemize}
However, these systems are still still standalone systems, rather
than integrated into Virtual Learning Environment courses. \citep{Douce2006,Ihantola2010}


\subsection{Virtual Learning Environments}

A Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) is an online Content Management
System for online and mixed-mode courses. First generation Virtual
Learning Environments were monolithic, one-size-fits-all systems.
More recently, VLE implementors have moved towards more flexible,
modular systems, that are easier to customise and to integrate with
other systems. \citep{Britain2004b}

\citeauthor{Britain2004b} caricaturise content delivery in first
generation VLEs as, ``read this material, check the forum and do
the test''. Improving Learning Activity Design is an area of active
research. \citep{Richards2006}


\subsection{The Moodle Virtual Learning Environment}

Moodle is a VLE that has grown from a PhD project to have an estimated
70 million users at 81,000 registered sites in 233 countries. \citep{MoodleTrust2013c}
It is designed from social constructivist pedagogical principles,
but does not impose this pedagogy on its users. \citep{Dougiamas2003}
Moodle\textquoteright{}s open license, modular architecture, and thriving
community of developers make it an excellent example of how the open
source development model can succeed. \citep{Hunt2012b,Raymond2008}

Moodle's quiz plugin allows tutors to write questions, store them
in a question bank, and assemble them into automatically marked quizzes.
Question types are implemented as plugins that conform to an API defined
in the quiz plugin. \citep{MoodleTrust2013} It is even possible to
implement questions that are hosted on another server. \citep{MoodleTrust2012}

\section{Methodology}


\subsection{Literature Review}

In my review I will seek answers to the following questions, in roughly
the order given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What pedagogical framework should guide my work? 
\item What criteria and methods can I use to evaluate an assessment tool? 
\item What tools already exist? How well do they meet the needs and criteria
I have identified? What can I learn from them?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Developing Requirements}

Informed by my literature review, I will ask myself the following
questions, in roughly this order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the goals of the system?
\item What is the minimum that I must implement in order to achieve a usable
prototype? These are my core requirements.
\item What are the most desirable features that I can implement in the remaining
time available? These are my advanced requirements.
\item What are the properties of a pedagogically useful implementation?
These are my evaluation criteria.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation}


\subsubsection{Methodological rules of thumb}

Hughes and Cotterall \citep[2006, cited in][p.131]{Dawson2009} recommend
the following rules of thumb for choosing a methodology:
\begin{itemize}
\item If uncertainty is high then use an evolutionary approach or throw-away
prototyping approach.
\item If complexity is high but uncertainty is low then use the incremental
approach.
\item If uncertainty and complexity are both low then use the conventional
waterfall-type model.
\item If the schedule is tight then use a conventional or incremental approach.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Core objectives}

My core objectives include implementing a Moodle plug-in to meet the
minimal core pedagogical requirements. At this stage, I will face
the following technical risks:
\begin{itemize}
\item I am unfamiliar with many of the APIs I will be using, so subjective
complexity will be high.
\item I work full-time, so my schedule will be tight.
\end{itemize}
According to Hughes and Cotterall's rules of thumb, a conventional
waterfall-type approach would be suitable at this stage.


\subsubsection{Advanced objectives}

My advanced objectives include extending my Moodle plug-in to meet
the advanced pedagogical requirements. At this stage, my technical
risks will have changed a little:
\begin{itemize}
\item I will be more familiar with the APIs, so subjective complexity will
be lower.
\item Although my schedule will still be tight, there will be less of a
sense of urgency because my core objectives will have already been
completed.
\item My work will become more exploratory in nature, so the uncertainty
will be much higher.
\end{itemize}
According to Hughes and Cotterall's rules of thumb, an evolutionary
or throw-away prototyping approach will be suitable at this stage.
I will adopt the evolutionary approach rather than throw-away prototyping
because, if unit testing is well supported, this approach is more
efficient. The APIs I will use support unit tests well.


\subsection{Evaluation}

I will conduct a heuristic evaluation, in the style of \citealp{Nielsen}.
The exact heuristics to use will be one of the subjects of my literature
review.


\subsection{Expert evaluation}

For the expert review, I will invite domain experts to test the system
with a demonstration server, and to submit their comments through
an on-line form. I need to research how best to structure this activity.

\section{Project Plan}

See Table \vref{tab:Submisison-deadlines} for my submission deadlines,
and Table \vref{tab:Plan-of-work} for my work schedule. This plan
includes the production of many artefacts, which are all listed in
Table \vref{tab:Artefacts}.

When I submit my Interim Project Report on 2013-10-07 (see Table \ref{tab:Submisison-deadlines}),
I plan to have:
\begin{itemize}
\item completed the literature review
\item developed the pedagogical requirements and evaluation criteria
\item implemented the core frontend
\item started work on the backend, and possibly completed it
\end{itemize}
Even with the six weeks of overrun, my schedule is optimistic. If
I experience delays, I can gain up to five weeks by dropping my advanced
objectives, and still complete an adequate project.

is a wiki server that uses \emph{git} for versional control.
\item [{Document~and~reference~management}] \emph{Mendeley}
\item [{Report~writing}] \emph{\LyX{}:} is an\emph{ }easy-to-use tool
for preparing \LaTeX documents
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Demonstration server}

Various solutions are available. I expect I will either use a commercial
Moodle hosting service, or install Moodle on a server hosted by a
general purpose hosting service such as \emph{AWS}.


\subsubsection{Robustness}
\begin{description}
\item [{Basic~infrastructure}] I am fortunate enough to live in a region
where reliable electricity can be taken for granted. %
\footnote{Brave words, coming from a resident of the most geologically active
region in the world. In the event of a major earthquake, volcanic
eruption, or tsunami, my backup plan is the university's Severe Adverse
Circumstances procedure \citep{UniversityofHertfordshireAcademicCircumstances2011}.%
} I am currently looking into backups for my internet connection.
\item [{Remote~backup}] All my data is automatically cloud-synchronised
with \emph{Dropbox}, \emph{Github} and / or \emph{Mendeley}.
\item [{Local~backup}] I will regularly backup to a memory stick.
\item [{Error~recovery}] My journal and source code are under \emph{git}
version control.
\item [{Hardware}] As a stopgap measure, I have a netbook available. All
the software I use can run on \emph{Windows}, \emph{GNU Linux} and
\emph{Mac OS X}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Skills.}
\begin{description}
\item [{Programming~and~document~languages}] I believe I am proficient
enough in HTML, Javascript, PHP, and CSS to complete this project.
\item [{APIs}] My project plan includes time to familiarise myself with
the necessary APIs, especially \emph{Moodle} and \emph{Yahoo User
Interface}.
\item [{System~administration}] Modern package management tools make this
task very easy, and I have already had success installing the Moodle
system, piece-by-piece, on my personal computer. If, despite this,
the challenge of deploying a Moodle installation proves beyond me\textbf{,}
I can turn to a commercial Moodle hosting service.
\item [{Co-ordinating~an~expert~evaluation}] My project plan includes
time to research and plan this activity.
\end{description}

\section{Relation to Target Award}

My target award is MSc in e-Learning technology. According to the
programme specification \citep{UniversityofHertfordshireSchoolofComputerScience2013},
students completing this course should:
\begin{itemize}
\item have a systematic knowledge and a critical awareness of current research
in the area of E-Learning Technology
\item have a comprehensive understanding of theoretical background upon
which e-learning design and development can be founded
\item can evaluate methodologies and develop critiques of them, and propose
ways to implement them in the design and development of e-learning
technologies
\item can create e-learning resources, and justify design and development
decisions made on the basis of pedagogical as well as technical requirements
\item can make informed choices about the technologies and approaches to
use in a given educational context, and critically analyse and evaluate
given e-learning technologies
\end{itemize}
In my project, I will demonstrate that I have achieved these aims
by:
\begin{itemize}
\item reviewing the relevant pedagogical literature
\item using my review and general pedagogical principles to write a specification
for an e-learning resource
\item implementing the resource
\item evaluating and improving my implementation
\end{itemize}

\section{Ethics Approval}

One of my advanced objectives is to have my system ``evaluated by
domain experts''. In accordance with the university ethical guidelines,
I will not go ahead with this until I have received approval from
the Ethics Committee.

For the other parts of my project, the only organisms involved will
be my technical and academic advisors. Ethical approval will not be
necessary, but I will be sure to acknowledge their contributions.
