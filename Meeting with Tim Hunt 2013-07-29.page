Tim very kindly gave me a copy of [Hollingsworth1960]() which is, to my knowledge,
the earliest system in the literature to use unit tests to grade student code submissions.

I submitted my [Extended Project Proposal]() on the same day as the meeting,
so I e-mailed him a copy before we met, and he kindly took the time to read through it.
He said that, unless I was a really exceptional programmer,
he didn't think my implementation schedule was realistic,
but he changed his mind
when I explained to him just how technically modest my plans were.

I have a bare Moodle installation on my PC,
so Tim shows me how Moodle logs all quiz interactions
by executing the following query (via phpMyAdmin)
as he completed a multiple choice question:
Or use a delimited code block:

~~~ {.sql}
SELECT *
FROM mdl_quiz_attempts quiza
JOIN mdl_question_usages qu ON qu.id = quiza.uniqueid
JOIN mdl_question_attempts qa ON qa.questionusageid = qu.id
JOIN mdl_question_attempt_steps qas ON qas.questionattemptid = qa.id
JOIN mdl_question_attempt_step_data qasd ON qasd.attemptstepid = qas.id

ORDER BY quiza.id, qa.slot, qas.sequencenumber, qasd.name
~~~
