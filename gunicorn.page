# Installing and launching gunicorn

    $ workon sasanqua
    $ pip install gunicorn
    $ cdproject
    $ vim sasanqua/sasanqua/settings.py # add 'gunicorn' to INSTALLED_APPS
    $ sasanqua/manage.py run_gunicorn

Yes. It's really that simple!  It listens to socket 8000,
just like the default server does.

**BUT** according to the [Django docs][django docs note about using wsgi to run gunicorn]:

> If you are using Django 1.4 or newer,
> itâ€™s highly recommended to simply run your application
> with the WSGI interface using the `gunicorn` command as described above.

[django docs note about using wsgi to run gunicorn]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/howto/deployment/wsgi/gunicorn/

So we do it this way instead:

    $ cdproject
    $ cd sasanqua
    $ gunicorn sasanqua.wsgi:application

We need to move to the same directory where manage.py is installed,
so that the relevant files are visible in python's module load path.

The specification `sasanqua.wsgi:application` is kindof like
`from sasanqua.wsgi import application`.
The function `application` accepts HTTP requests, packaged in a certain way,
and returns HTTP responses.
