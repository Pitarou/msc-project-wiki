This forms part of my interim project report.

# Notes from Audio File

## Dr. Bodo Scholz

* Demonstrate mastery in science

    + delivers new knowledge
         - may be incremental
    + combine background research combined with work that immediately delivers a real tangible results, which demonstrates real work that goes beyond background reading

## Bruce Christianson

Looking for 3 things:

1. Technical competence
2. Engagement with a real problem
3. A dissertation that tells a story

What's the question?  What are you investigating?

What's your methodology?  How are you going to go about answering the question.

What are the alternatives?  What alternatives did you consider, and what models did you use to choose between them?

What does success mean?  How good is the thing that you built, and what criteria did you use to evaluate it?

It has to be original (your own work), but it's fine to start with someone else's work and reproduce it yourself and, indeed, this is how a lot of good projects start.

## James Malcolm

A good project is **not** just an exercise in software development, or background reading.  It tries to answer an interesting-looking question with a practical piece of software.

## Paul Wernick

Don't select something too small.  Choose something with an achievable core, but has some meaty extensions.  A fair amount of reading, or research.

The sad thing is where you do something too small, and there's nowhere to expand it.  Ideally, it should have PhD potential.

And it's fine to repeat another's work.

If there's something on the research side that bugs you, go with it.

Make sure you're enjoying doing it.  If you want to derail it slightly, go to your supervisor and ask them.

# What makes a good MSc Project?

## Summary of interview

A good MSc project should:

 * be original (but need not be groundbreaking)
 * address a worthwhile question or problem
 * be grounded in research
 * be methodologically sound
 * demonstrate a grasp of the current state of knowledge
 * demonstrate principled consideration of alternative approaches
 * demonstrate technical skill through the delivery of a substantial artefact
 * have clear criteria for evaluation, and apply them
 * have a core that is readily deliverable
 * have substantial scope for expansion

Two tips for generating project ideas:

 * Reproduce earlier work on another platform, and extend it.
 * Find a question in the literature that bugs you, and answer it.

And two tips for a successful project:

 * Don't pick too narrow a topic; ideally, it should be possible to extend it to a PhD.
 * Enjoy it!  If you want to change the focus of your work, ask your supervisor.

## Discussion

I found the interview clear and helpful.  Some of Bruce Christianson's suggestions seemed a little too technically focussed for my project, but the general idea that I should take a principled approach to decision-making still applies.
