On Phenomenography, Learning and Teaching
-----------------------------------------

Abstract
--------

Phenomenographic research has tackled questions concerning the variation in ways in which people experience the phenomena they meet in the world around them.  The empirical work directly addressing educational issues has to a large extent focused on describing qualitatively different ways in which particular sorts of students understand a phenomenon, or experience some aspect of the world, which is central to their education, and setting the results into the educational context of interest.  Learning is viewed as being a change in the ways in which one is capable of experiencing some aspect of the world and other research has been linked to attempts to bring about such changes by utilising certain approaches to teaching.  This article will outline principles for teaching based, on the one hand, on the body of empirical phenomenographic research and, on the other hand, on an emerging picture of the nature of human awareness.  The principles will first be drawn, explicated with the help of a number of empirical studies in the phenomenographic tradition, and then the whole will be illustrated through an example of a study of learning and teaching programming at university.

Introduction
------------

Phenomenography as a research approach grew out of investigations into students' experience of learning, which focused on finding out how university students approached their ordinary studies, reading texts on themes relevant to their overall course of instruction, and what understanding and retention they achieved (Marton, 1981; Marton & Booth, 1996).  In that context, "learning" means developing a way of seeing the phenomenon dealt with in the text by reading and studying the arguments the author puts forward.  If we limit our attention to educational settings, we can say that in general "learning" means coming to an understanding of curricular content as a result of tackling various learning activities.  As a result of the task, a new way of experiencing the content is reached.  Thus there are two aspects to any learning situation which, while being inextricably intertwined and probably unconsidered for the learner, are important analytical aspects for the researcher.  They are referred to as the "what" of learning and the "how" of learning; the "what" concerns the quality of the understanding arrived at, or the perspective taken on, or the conception held of the *content* of the learning task, as a result of the learning activity; and the "how" concerns more the nature of *the act of tackling* the learning task, whether reading texts, or solving problems or doing experiments in the laboratory.

Those early studies led to three important insights into student learning.  First, the question of what is learned in any learning task is not unproblematic---different students can understand one and the same text, or indeed one and the same concept, in a number of different ways.  They do not, however, each understand it in their own unique way; rather, a set of qualitatively different ways of understanding can be arrived at which has an internal logic with respect to the intended meaning of the text. This has become a corner-stone of phenomenographic research. Second, there are qualitatively different ways in which students go about, or approach, the tasks of learning, namely a *deep approach* which is distinguished by a search for meaning in the text and a *surface approach* which focuses instead on the words comprising the text.  The third insight was into the relation between approaches and outcomes: students who adopted a deep approach achieved overwhelmingly superior understanding of the message of the text and also retained information better than their surface studying colleagues.

From a phenomenographic perspective, learning is shifting from not being able to do something to being able to do it, as a result of some experience.  The term "being able to do something" can be interpreted widely---for example, as being able to perform a concrete task such as ride a bicycle; or apply a procedure to a sort of problem, such as using book keeping procedures to investigate a company's finances; or see something in a particular way, such as famine as a political problem as well as an agricultural one. The experience is necessarily a learning experience, whether it is one of falling off a bicycle and being helped by an older sister to keep balance, or reading about and discussing the problems of the underdeveloped world. The sort of learning that phenomenographic research has mostly been concerned with---and which I will restrict myself to here---is of the latter type---coming to see something in a certain way as a result of undertaking learning tasks that are met in educational settings.

Principles for Teaching Implied by Phenomenographic Research
------------------------------------------------------------

On the basis of phenomenographic research and teaching initiatives based on phenomenographic results, Marton and Booth (1996) asked the following about the implications of phenomenographic research for teaching methods:

> What methods of teaching can we devise
> to bring about the deep approaches
> with their quality learning outcomes?

and answered themselves, saying:

> The answer is to hand---there is no such method,
> in the sense of generally applicable rules and criteria.
> What we can say, however, and with great emphasis,
> is that the overarching principle
> of achieving quality outcomes
> is to thematise both the act and the content
> of learning in the very act of teaching. (Marton & Booth, 1996)

This can be analysed into a progression of four practical principles, adapted from their discussion:

 *  The teacher has to be aware both of
    the content of learning---less as a content in itself,
    encapsulated in a disciplinary framework,
    but more as content as it *is*
    and as it *should be* understood
    by the learners---and of the acts
    of learning---analogous in function,
    though different in detail,
    to deep and surface approaches.

 *  The teacher has to take an analytical stance
    to the phenomena to be taught about
    and to the nature of the teaching context
    and learning tasks as perceived by the learner,
    and identify those *educationally critical aspects*
    which might otherwise be taken for granted.

 *  The teacher has to ensure that the learners *reveal
    their experience of learning*, in terms of
    the various ways in which they understand
    that which is learned
    and the various ways in which they
    go about the tasks of learning---the what and the how
    of learning---and subject it to reflection.
    By becoming aware of the possibility
    of a variation in ways of experiencing a phenomenon
    and by considering that variation,
    the way is opened to the possibility for change.

 *  The teacher has to ensure that
    the tasks of learning are integrated
    into that world which the learners experience;
    we explain learning as *a change
    in the way the learner experiences the world;
    which means that the relevance of the task
    has to be seen to transcend the task in itself*
    and have some personal meaning for the learner.

Finally, the four principles have to be implemented in the teaching situation; in other words, the teacher needs to design and engineer the tasks and context of learning with these principles at the fore.

In the rest of this article, I wish to explore
the origin, the significance and the consequences
 of these four statements.
In particular, I want to draw on
my own particular research interest
in computer science education
and consider the possibilities and potential pitfalls
in a proposed change from a traditional
lecture/exercise/laboratory structure
to a problem-based and interdisciplinary structure.

*What* is it That is Learned?
-----------------------------

Who can't remember getting stuck over a problem
or a particular piece of work,
and being told by the teacher---but you learned that last term! You've learned long division,
you've learned Newton's laws,
you've learned to integrate by parts,
you've learned recursion, and so on.
Yes, last term you could work out
how many buses would be needed to take 452 children
to the zoo if each bus holds 54 passengers,
or calculate the maximum velocity of a projectile
moving under gravity, or write a program
involving a recursive function, but today it is a mystery.
Maybe it was just
a problem of memory---you've simply forgotten or confused
some key point. But maybe, while last term
you had learned Newton's laws, or whatever,
in detail enough to satisfy the demands of the moment,
that learning had not led to the understanding necessary for later recall. Hence the plea for help.
What you had learned was 
in all probability---as
phenomenographic research indicates---the
facts and algorithms suited to solving the typical
questions asked at the time.

Most phenomenographic research which addresses questions of what is learned looks at key concepts in one discipline or another.  The question asked is: How do the group of people we are interested in understand, or experience, this or that concept or phenomenon before and/or after studying it?  Some way is devised for probing the understandings held, generally by looking at the central notions from a number of perspectives in a deep and open interview with individuals chosen to exhaust the range of learners present, i.e., a theoretical sample, as described by Glaser and Strauss (1967).  That the interview is *open* means that while a structure might be planned in advance, to approach the phenomenon in question from various interesting perspectives, the interviewer is prepared to follow unexpected lines of reasoning that can lead to fruitful new reflections. That the interview is *deep* means that particular lines of discussion are followed until they are exhausted and the two parties have come to a state of mutual understanding.

Analysis focuses on identifying a small number of qualitatively distinct descriptive categories of the ways in which the subjects experience (or understand, or conceptualise) the phenomena of interest.  It consists of studying the interview transcripts, both individually and alongside one another, studying sets of extracts both in and out of their original contexts, seeking distinct similarities and differences.  The researcher immerses himself or herself in the material, trying to see the total meaning in what the research subjects said and did, resolving apparent contradictions, knitting together as whole a picture of the meaning of the phenomenon as possible, not only for individual subjects but also for the group.  Eventually a spectrum is seen.  As the material is studied further, features of the spectrum might shift, new features might be resolved and others merge, logical links might be seen between features and the phenomenon in question, and spectra might be seen in different dimensions.  The set of categories arrived at can be considered to be satisfactory when an internal logical relationship, a hierarchy, is seen to exist between them, which can in turn be related to other descriptions of the phenomenon in question.  The whole process may need to be repeated many times before this state is reached. 

Many such studies have been carried out, looking at such concepts as the ideas of number in school starters (Neuman, 1987), the nature of matter in secondary pupils (Renström, 1988), and Newton's laws in university students (Johansson, Marton & Svensson 1985).

### Variation in What is Learned

Let us follow up the last mentioned (and much researched) example.  Newton's first law states that a body remains in its state of rest or uniform motion unless a force be applied to change it.  This draws a critical distinction between, on the one hand, rest or uniform motion implying the net absence of force and, on the other hand, change in uniform motion (acceleration or deceleration) implying the net presence of force.  In contrast, in common belief, and as attributed to Aristotle, the distinction occurs between rest implying no force and motion implying force, an understanding which proves particularly resistant to change.  The studies by Johansson *et al.* (1985), found both of these qualitatively different conceptions among university engineering students, in spite of them having taken a course in mechanics, and that while students had in many ways learned to derive, apply and manipulate the formulae derived from Newton's laws, they had retained the qualitative understanding of Aristotle.  This is a finding which the teachers were only dimly aware of---it was known that students sometimes made unaccountable errors in reasoning, but not that such a fundamental difference in thinking was to blame.   Subsequently, teachers made use of this new knowledge to diagnose the answers that students gave to carefully designed questions, and then were given the opportunity to discuss the alternatives that had been found, "enabling personal involvement and focus on the desired conception to be combined" (Svensson & Hogförs, 1988).  This is an example of the part of the first of the four principles for teaching---as it deals with *what* is learned---being put into practice.  The teacher became aware of the content of learning less as a content in itself, encapsulated in the disciplinary framework of Newtonian mechanics, but rather as the learners should have understood it (Newtonian) and as many of them actually did understand it (Aristotelian).

Ramsden (1992) claims:

> The professional authority of the academic-as-scholar
> rests on a body of knowledge;
> the professional authority of the academic-as-teacher
> should rest on a body of didactic knowledge.
> This comprises knowledge of
> how the subject he or she professes
> is best learned and taught (p. 9).

This new form of knowledge for the teacher to strive after can be called *didactic disciplinary knowledge*, in contrast to the *scholarly disciplinary knowledge* they have won as a result of their own studies and research.

### Educationally Critical Aspects of What is Learned

Concomitant with gaining and exploiting such didactic disciplinary knowledge, the question arises of the exact nature of the understanding we are hoping for in just *these* students, when we plan and implement our teaching.  When planning a curriculum there is a natural delimitation according to our perception of what it is reasonable for these students to know and understand.  One important criterion is what is *educationally critical* for just these students, and that has different significance in different educational contexts.

If we consider Newton's first law---which deals with the notions of force, motion, rest, velocity, acceleration, and change, as well as the formulae derived from Newton's mathematical treatment and the typical applications---we see that the two conceptions identified by Johansson *et al.* (1985) indicate that different students have focally different awareness of these notions.  Aristotelian thinking focuses on force and resulting motion while Newtonian thinking focuses on rest, force, and motion, and on the *change* associated with the presence of force.  This is critically important for students who are not only going to be able to solve simple problems by rote but must also, as university students of engineering, be able to model dynamic systems in mathematical terms.  Here again, we have identified an educationally critical aspect of the content, which is formulated as part of the second principle of teaching.

### Revealing the Variation

The practising teacher might respond: But no-one can be expected to identify all the different ways of understanding that my pupils might have, and researchers do not interest themselves in the gamut of topics I have to teach.  Quite so, but there are certain facets of the teacher's special knowledge and everyday work that could suffice as a base for discovering such insights, and it is now important to design the educational context such that the variation is revealed.  Returning to the study of how students understood Newton's laws, an attempt was made to lift conceptions to the conscious level by organising dialogues between students.  In an introductory course, students were paired to discuss the phenomena they would meet, pairs got together and compared results, and finally the whole class discussed them. Svensson and Högfors (1988) report that:

> The teacher and the students found the approach very useful
> in that it revealed real differences in conceptions
> of phenomena among the students.
> This formed an excellent basis
> for clarifying the critical characteristics
> of the conceptions taught
> as opposed to the alternative conceptions
> expressed by some of the students (p. 170).

Teachers who do not have access to such research results are able to draw on their teaching experience, furnished with a phenomenographic perspective on teaching and learning---the analytical stance called for---and the scholarly knowledge they have within their discipline.  The teacher of mechanics has a very thorough and clearly differentiated knowledge of the field of thinking around the first law.  When presented with a situation, a problem, that requires that thinking to be applied, he or she becomes rapidly aware of the important factors, the relations between them, where the difficulties might lie, and a number of ways to reach a solution.  The students have, collectively, a wide but not necessarily differentiated understanding of the same field.  Individually, they are aware only partially of the factors involved in the field and, when they are faced with a problem, there is not the same clarity of what is central to the problem nor the same awareness of a variety of ways of tackling it.  In these terms, the dialogues Svensson and Högfors (1988) describe are a move towards the collective understanding being revealed to the teacher and to the collective body of students. Not only do individual students begin to enrich their own personal understanding but the teacher also learns what the students know, which gives the foundation for further development through discussion:

> According to the teacher, the teaching became easier
> after the exercise. Although incomplete,
> the student's awareness of his or her own conceptions
> together with some alternative conceptions
> seemed to liberate him or her in relation to
> the theoretical structure presented in the teaching.
> Students appeared to acquire the ability
> to investigate the structure taught
> from different viewpoints (p. 173).

The Structure of Awareness
--------------------------

Let us consider what the student is aware of when faced with a problem. We can continue with Newtonian mechanics and focus on one of the questions that Svensson and Högfors (1988) used: "A cyclist is cycling straight forward at a high constant speed on a road. What forces act on the bicycle?"  From the field of ideas which this statement conjures up, some theme will emerge, the focus or object of the thinkers' awareness.  In that force is the object of the question, that might be the initial theme.  "Force", the theme, is figural in awareness, and associated with the theme there are other aspects of the problem, related by some relevance to the theme.  Here we might expect to find notions about motion, constant speed, velocity and acceleration, motive and retarding forces, the force of gravity, mass, weight, etc.  While force is figural---the object of thought---this field of notions forms the background.  We can say that force is the *theme of awareness* and all the rest form the *thematic field*.  The items which are thematic constitute a gestalt, which is conjoined with the constituents of the thematic field through unity of context or unity of relevance.  Then, the student is also certainly aware of non-relevant things which are present at the same time in the background, such as the time of day and the noise outside the window, or the lecture that has just finished, and these we can call the *margin*.  Rather than thinking of three clearly demarcated areas of the field of awareness, as this simple description conjures up, we might benefit from seeing it as a gradated thing, margin merging with more peripheral aspects of the thematic field, and the more prominent aspects of the thematic field being allied with the periphery of the theme.

This structure of awareness originates in the works of the phenomenological philosopher Gurwitsch (1964), and forms a powerful frame for developing our own thoughts on variation in the learner's understanding, as has been further elaborated in Marton and Booth (1997).  One can think of the structure of awareness as a relationship between the person and the object of consciousness.  The person perceiving or considering the object of interest---the bicycle being cycled along the road---from one aspect brings to it their total experience and awareness, and the theme emerges from that total awareness according to the way in which the object presents itself, drawing with it the relevant items to comprise the thematic field.  For either the teacher or student considering the cyclist pedalling along the road, focally aware of the notion of force, a thematic field of force-related notions might well emerge.  A shift to consider another aspect brings with it a shift in theme and thematic field, within the confines of the total field of awareness.  Thus, shifting to focus on the theme of constant speed, another aspect of the problem, might lead to a shift in thematic field to include the notion of equilibrium, i.e., lack of change, or alternatively the personal experience of having to pedal hard to maintain a constant speed, which runs counter to the notion of equilibrium.

The structure of the learner's awareness is, as I have already pointed out, relatively vague and undifferentiated compared to that of the much more experienced teacher.  Faced with a problem, not only will the initial theme be less sure, but also the thematic field will be more labile.  The relationship between the learner and this object of thought, the structure of awareness, is less rich than the teacher's.  The student who is not strongly aware of the relation between equilibrium of forces and constancy of motion in a straight line will only have personal physical experience to draw upon, the everyday experience of cycling, and that involves pedalling.  What is not personal physical experience is the range of forces acting on the bicycle in the direction of motion---road friction and wind, for example.  Thus there will be a strong tendency for the thematic field to lean towards the notions of disequilibrium.  The teacher has had many opportunities to abstract away from personal experience.  The relations between equilibrium of forces and constant or zero speed, and between net force and *change* in speed, are strong in the teacher's awareness.

Thus the teacher who does consider and try to reveal the variation in how students understand the content they are meeting is engaging with the students' collective awareness. In identifying educationally critical aspects of the content, the teacher is examining his or her own awareness in the light of what is now known of the students' awareness, and analysing what strong relationships they need to be able to face a problem in a productive way.

*How* is What is Learned Learned?
---------------------------------

Both of the first two principles for teaching which I opened with concerned both the what and the how aspects of learning---content and approach---and so far I have only spoken of the significance of paying attention to the content aspect.  I will deal more briefly with the how aspect, in that the underlying research findings on variation in approach to learning tasks and critical importance of particular approaches follow the same pattern as the work on the content of learning.

### Variation in Approaches to Learning

Just as it has been found as the result of numerous empirical studies that different learners understand the content they are learning in qualitatively distinct ways, so it has been found that they approach the learning tasks they undertake in distinctly different ways.  The fundamental result that is to be seen in all such studies is that there are two distinctly different ways of tackling a learning task, which can be generalised as a *deep* approach and a surface approach to learning.  Drawing on Gurwitsch's (1964) description of the field of awareness, a functional relationship between deep approaches and quality learning can also be developed (Marton & Booth, 1996).

This pair of approaches was first described in connection with a series of studies of university students learning by reading typical texts.  In one study, Säljö (1982) gave students a lengthy text on forms of learning, in which different perspectives on learning were described and related to examples of their occurrence.  For example, classical conditioning was described and related to the examples of experiments with dogs and an instance of a prisoner who had undergone severe torture by electric shock who felt the entire response to a shock merely on seeing the electrodes.  Afterwards, the participants were asked, among other questions, "What is the text about?" and, "How did you go about learning the text?"  He found that there were these two distinctly different ways in which they had tackled the task.  Some had *learned from the text*; they related the different forms of learning they read about to one another and to their own experiences of learning; they related the examples given to the theory they were intended to illustrate; they aimed to absorb the meaning of the text.  Such is a deep approach.  Other students tried instead to *learn the text itself* in order to be able to recall it later; they focused on the theories and the examples in isolation from one another, giving them equal status; they aimed to absorb the text verbatim.  Such is a surface approach.

A further result of this study, of utmost importance for the development of the principles of teaching, is that students who had adopted a deep approach in general understood the text in a qualitatively better way---in greater detail and in a more integrated and coherent form---and they retained it longer.  The surface approach led to an understanding which was of poorer quality which isolated bits of the text treated as a sequence, without reference to one another, and which resulted in poorer recall.

![Figure 1: Graphical illustration of structures imposed on a text about forms of learning, comprising descriptions of forms of learning and illustrative examples, with (a) coherent, integrated and (b) sequential understandings (Booth & Marton, 1996; after Säljö, 1982).](/Booth1997 figure 1.png)

Figures 1 (a) and (b), taken from Marton and Booth (1996), and adapted from diagrams in Säljö (1982), illustrate both the quality of the understanding in the upper parts of each diagram, and the approach to reading the text in the lower part.  Thus, in the deep approach the meaning or overall theme of the text is always present to awareness, developing all the time as the student focuses on a particular form of learning as sub-theme and its illustrations.  In the surface approach, first a description of a form of learning is read and then an example, but they are not seen as sub-themes of an overarching theme, or as being related to one another, either in the act of reading or in the presentation of understanding.  Awareness shifts from sub-theme to example and on to next sub-theme; the overall theme is never present to awareness.

### Educationally Critical Approaches to Learning

In as much as deep approaches are associated in many empirical studies with superior learning, we can say that identifying its counterpart in a particular situation is itself educationally critical.  We can go further and describe such approaches and outcomes in terms of Gurwitsch's (1964) theory of awareness, thereby placing the claim on a more embracing theoretical foundation.

As the student sits reading the text, they are aware of the task they are involved in.  While some particular aspect of the situation is thematic in awareness, other aspects constitute the thematic field, and there is a dynamic switching between themes with a corresponding restructuring of thematic fields, all according to an overall experience and experienced relevance.  Now some of them are aware of the text in a similar way: they are aware of different aspects of the text at the same time, each theme being associated with a field and theme replacing theme, field replacing field.  Others, on the other hand, experience it in a distinctly different way in that simultaneity is lacking: they read it bit by bit by bit and never build up an overall understanding of the text in which aspects of the meaning of the text are present at the same time.  For them, awareness lacks a dynamic that keeps themes and thematic fields in a state of a constant restructuring of awareness.

Although the *variation* of approach to learning tasks embodied in the deep and surface dichotomy is to be seen in many learning situations, its exact nature differs according to situation.  This has been clearly seen in cross-cultural studies of learning from texts; expectations of identical forms of approaches to learning among Asian students as Western students had led to paradoxical observations which were resolved through the insight that Asian students actually have a different form of deep approach, which to the casual observer has characteristics in common with a surface approach in the west (Marton, Dall'Alba & Tse, 1993).

Studies of different sorts of learning task also indicate the deep and surface approach dichotomy, but again with content-specific and task-specific factors, exemplified by the work described in the chapters of *The experience of learning* (Marton, Hounsell & Entwhistle (Eds.) 1984).  There, approaches equivalent to deep and surface have been identified for other typical learning tasks in higher education, such as listening to lectures (Hodgson, 1984) and writing essays (Hounsell, 1984).  The variation of approaches which computer science students took to writing programs to solve problems, which we will return to in the second part of this article, also correspond in essence to the deep and surface approaches (Booth, 1992b).  The detailed description of deep and surface differ according to specific content and learning task, but the essential quality is that deep approaches are seeking meaning in the task viewed in the overall learning situation, whereas the surface approach is more focused on the task *per se*.

### Revealing the Variation

Once such distinctly different approaches to tasks of learning have been identified, and the relation between approaches to learning and the quality of learning has been established, teachers naturally want their students to adopt the more fruitful of the approaches.  In connection with the earliest studies on learning from texts this was indeed attempted.  It was observed that in applying deep approaches the successful learners ask themselves questions and, accordingly, questions were interjected orally while the participants were reading, in an attempt to encourage all the readers to adopt the habits of the successful readers (Marton, 1976).  Questions were posed while the text was being read, with the intention of focusing readers' attention on finding structure in the way that readers with deep approaches did spontaneously.  As described in Marton and Booth (1996):

> The results were disastrous;
> such interventions were found to have an effect
> the reverse of that intended.
> An erosion effect was noted
> as a result of the technification
> of the reading process;
> the readers actually learned less,
> as a result of merely mimicking the deep approach
> by seeking only structure and losing sight of the content,
> thereby adopting an extreme surface approach.

Nor is there much to be gained from some general training in study skills or reading skills, as so many schools and colleges provide for their students.  Certainly, the disorganised student might gain by managing his time better, as the result of such a course, or it might occur to the hopelessly non-studious that assignments need to be handed in on time.  But consider Perry, reporting on 20 years of a programme in reading skills at Harvard, who said [Perry, 1959, quoted in Gibbs, 1981, pp. 31-32]:

> The instruction that assists them [to read better]
> does not center on the mechanics of reading.
> The mechanics of reading are inseparable at this level
> from the individual's purpose as he reads.
> If you train someone in mechanics alone,
> he drops right back into his old habits
> the minute he picks up an assigned text... .
> There can be no general rules for teaching
> the exercise of judgement in reading.
> Such judgement requires courage,
> and courage cannot be taught by rule,
> it can only be dared, or redirected,
> *in ways appropriate to particular subjects
> and learning task*. [my italics]

A more recent study of programmes attempting to raise standards of study has also revealed the inadequacy of content-free programmes (Martin & Ramsden, 1987).  They compared the results of two programmes, one of which used generic material separate from the curriculum content while the other, called learning how to learn, made use of material drawn from the current history curriculum.  The students in the latter group were seen to develop more advanced conceptions of learning, in accord with a deep approach, and in addition got better grades on essays and achieved better examination results.  Thus, separating the *what* from the *how* of learning and attempting to train the *how without reference to the *what* appears to be doomed to failure.

What the individual teacher has to do is design the teaching situation in such a way that the variation in approaches to tackling tasks in just that area is revealed, both to the teacher who thereby gains further insight into the experience of the learner, and to the learners who thereby gain insight not only into the range of possibilities but also that a range is actually possible.  The work of Svensson and Högfors (1988) which was described earlier illustrates just such an approach.

Now we have considered the origins and the implications of the third principle, namely, that the teacher has to ensure that learners reveal their experience of learning, in terms of the various ways in which they understand that which is learned and the various ways in which they go about the tasks of learning----the what and the how of learning---and *subject it to reflection*.  By becoming aware of the possibility of a variation in ways of experiencing a phenomenon and by considering that variation, one becomes open to the possibility of change.

### The Dynamics of Awareness

The structured awareness as I sketched it earlier is not a static thing, focused on the thematic gestalt with its attendant thematic field for the whole period of contemplation of an object.  Rather, the object is contemplated from different aspects, throwing different perspectives on the theme, which brings different thematic fields into awareness.  Thus, a student considering the object of a cyclist cycling along a straight road with constant speed can see it now with the aspect of theoretical mechanics, then with the aspect of personal lived experience.  Each of these will entrain a thematic field which is drawn from the overall field, but is now constituted of elements of force, velocity, etc., and then of pedalling, wind in the face, the intense scent of the hedgerow and so on.  Contemplating the object is thus a switching between different aspects of the object and the resulting thematic fields.

That is the starting point for a dynamic development of awareness, in that new themes arise from preceding thematic fields, and they are also subjected to consideration from different aspects. The person pondering the question of forces acting on the cyclist thus follows one path or another, through the field of notions associated with it, the theme of focal awareness at any time having a background thematic field, from which in turn a new theme is drawn, bringing with it another thematic field, constituted of much of the former one, and the former theme, and probably other elements which were unconsidered before.  At some times the theme will be the whole problem, and at other times it will be more limited, possibly some single item of the problem.

Looking at the problem from different angles---the whole object, one delimited part of it, personal physical experience, earlier theoretical reflections---thus leads to a juxtaposition of alternative themes and thematic fields.  In this juxtaposition, initially unrelated constituents of awareness fall into new positions of relatedness, which is the start of developing the structure of awareness.  The students who adopted a deep approach in Säljö's study, described earlier, read the text in this way---reading about a particular form of learning and then juxtaposing the examples to throw light on it, relating that to some personal experience and going on to relate the whole to the other forms of learning already read about.  At the end of the study they had not only formed an overall picture of perspectives on what learning might be considered to be, but also reflected on and deepened their understanding of their own experience of learning.  This is learning about forms of learning.  Those students who took a surface approach to the task, on the other hand, never gave themselves the opportunity to bring different parts of the text into relation to one another, or to the whole, or to their own condition, so intent were they on the printed text and the imposed task.  Maybe they learned isolated bits of the text in the sense that they could recount them shortly afterwards, but the restructuring of awareness is lacking from this approach, and learning is shallow.

Different contents of learning and different types of learning task give rise to different kinds of opportunity for developing awareness.  Discussion between peers brings the individual to consider different perspectives to bear on an object of thought in one way; a research task, a project or problem, gives the chance to follow up the questions that arise when thematic fields jar with one another; laboratory exercises give the student the opportunity for new personal experiences to be brought into contact with earlier theoretical considerations.  Deep approaches are indicated by students who take those opportunities to develop awareness in such ways.  It demands an openness to variation, a willingness to tussle with the resulting perspectives, a point of reference in personal experience, and a clarity to maintain focus on the object of thought.  Surface approaches to tasks are indicated when students neglect to see the object of their thought from different angles, or are unwilling or unable to cope with the tangle of ideas that arise, or who fail to relate tasks to their own experience, or who fail to keep the object of thought in focus.  Thus, even in the best case, learning occurs only in a limited sense.

The teacher who is aware of the variation in approaches to a learning task and who takes the analytical stance from which the educationally critical aspects of the approaches can be identified, is in the first place divining the way the student will best learn from an intended task.  The next stage is to design tasks that will create the conditions believed to be most auspicious for productive approaches.  To design such a task demands first that the teacher has a good understanding of the students' probable range of awareness of the intended object of thought---the variation in how they understand or experience it---and of its educationally critical aspects.  There follows a consideration of what experiences, whether personal or mediated through learning material of some sort, the student would benefit from; that is to say, what experiences would both lead to new perspectives being taken on the intended object of thought and offer a fertile juxtaposition.  A fertile juxtaposition means that the conflicts that arise should lend themselves to solution within the confines of the educational setting, and according to the premised variation in the students' prior understanding.  Then the necessary educational experiences have to be constructed.  The foundation has to be laid in that the underlying understanding has to be raised to the figure of awareness, the different perspectives that might fruitfully be taken have to be opened up, the views offered there have to be of such a character that they naturally bring focus back to the main object of thought.  It can be of advantage if the whole design is situated in an area where the student has some prior personal experience so that new perspectives and views also relate to that experience.  When the student moves to work on this task, the goals should be clearly formulated in terms of learning rather than simply in terms of accomplishing the task so that there is no confusion of expectations, and the necessary material should be readily accessible.

*Where* is What is Learned Learned?
-----------------------------------

The fourth principle enumerated in the introduction is that the teacher should integrate the tasks of learning into the world which the learners experience, transcending the experience of the task as an end in itself.  The preceding discussion of the role of awareness in designing tasks to bring about learning has already taken up the importance of locating tasks in a setting that the learner can relate to personal experience.  But even more, in as much as learning is a change in the way of experiencing something in one's world, a rooting of the experience in one's own world is of utmost importance for understanding.

If we look at arithmetic in the primary school, then we see that it is all too often taught in terms which very rapidly go over to abstract forms of standard examples which pupils experience as ends in themselves.  Even reading is taught in one sense divorced from the child's own world, not in that the topics taken up in reading books are foreign to the child, but that the very act of reading does not relate to the child's own world.  Children who start to learn to read without seeing any purpose for it in their own everyday life, either now or in the future, make relatively poor progress compared with those who, for example, want to read their own books, or know that you need to be able to read in order to play certain games or get a job (Dahlgren & Olsson 1985).

The question of learning in higher education is more problematic, in that students there are generally meeting ideas that they neither meet nor have to handle in their everyday worlds, knowledge that is essentially mediated in symbolic forms, whether it is nuclear physics, advanced book-keeping or theories of anthropology.  Laurillard (1993) questions the implications when she writes:

> The whole point about articulated knowledge
> is that being articulated it is known
> through exposition, argument, interpretation;
> it is known through reflection on experience
> and represents therefore a second-order experience
> of the world. Knowledge derived from experiencing the world
> at one remove must logically be accessed differently
> from that known through a first-order experience (p. 25).

She develops the point that much of the stuff met by university students can be related, by language, to everyday experience, with possible dire consequences (and she uses the Newtonian concept of force as an example of a word with a specific meaning in physics and a wide and conceivably misleading meaning in the everyday world).  She continues:

> Every academic subject faces this same kind of challenge,
> to help students go beyond their experience,
> to use it and reflect on it,
> and thereby change their perspective on it,
> and therefore change the way they experience the world.
> Everyday knowledge is located
> in our experience of the world.
> *Academic knowledge is located
> in our experience of our experience of the world*
> [my italics] (p. 26).

Thus the challenge for teachers in higher education, with respect to the fourth principle, is to make the world of the learner a world of reflection over the academic experience the student is engaged in.  Only then can the relevance of the task be seen to transcend the task in itself and have some personal meaning for the learner.

One interesting attempt to bring about just this formed part of a project into various innovative forms of teaching mathematics to first year engineering students at Chalmers University of Technology (Järner, Martinson & Fant, 1993).  This abandoned the traditional cycle of introduction to new concepts in lectures followed by the opportunity to solve related problems in supervised exercise classes.  Instead, new concepts were introduced through exercises which were handed to the students for independent study.  They were designed to lead the students from their (supposed) level of mathematical knowledge in stages towards the new material to be learned.  Then came one or more lectures which took up the concept in such a way that the students' questions would be handled, either through the foresight of the lecturer or at the students' own prompting.  At intervals throughout the course, overview lectures were held in which areas of mathematics were brought together to lend structure to the whole.  The point of the preliminary exercise-sheet was not that students would establish the central ideas for themselves (though that was always a possibility) but that they would come to the lecture with a background of half-formulated queries and difficulties.  In this way their own worlds, on the occasion of the lecture, encompassed the field of the new concepts, and they had questions of their own to hand, grounded in their own enquiry.  A mixed reception was only to be expected.  Some students did not comply with the new structure and tried to treat the course as a traditional lecture-led course, leading to frustration; others simply had not managed to organise their time to take in this unconventional approach.  Others, on the other hand, had been so impressed by the value of this preparation that they had adopted the same approach in other subjects and, for example, read ahead in the text book---not to get ahead of the course but to come to the lectures prepared with queries and questions (Booth, 1993b).

Examples from a Study of Learning to Program
--------------------------------------------

My own research interest has centred on students of computer science and mathematics in engineering degree courses.  The results of a longitudinal phenomenographic study of new university students learning to program (Booth, 1992) can be interpreted both according to the outline offered by studies into student learning, and in terms of Gurwitsch's (1964) picture of the field of awareness.  The results to be described come from a study of 14 new computer science and computer engineering undergraduates in their first term at university, who were learning to program in a functional programming language, SML, which is grounded in the mathematical lambda-calculus (Wikström, 1987).  They were chosen as a theoretical sample to reflect the distribution of age, educational and work background and gender of the 120 students in the year's intake.  They were interviewed six times each over a period of five months, employing a semi-structured interview technique in which a number of themes were taken up.  Some of the themes involved topics currently being worked with in the course (called in the study technical constituents of programming) while others were of a more general nature (framework constituents) and were taken up in more than one interview.  The technique involved introducing a theme and following it up until it was felt that a mutual understanding had been reached such that further probing was unlikely to yield further insights (Booth, 1992b).  In addition, they were asked to tackle examples of writing programs, very similar to the kind they were currently meeting in the course.

### Variation in the Students' Understanding of the Content

One notion central to programming in the language these students were studying, and indeed to most modern programming languages, is recursion, and it was also central to one interview a short time after it had been introduced in the course.  It is a construct which, as far as algorithms are concerned, facilitates repetition, in a rather special way.  Most commonly, in other programming environments, repetition in a program is achieved by using iterative constructs which repeat what they need to until a specific condition is met---for example, a number of cycles has been made, or a particular item has been found in the data.  To write such an algorithm in a program it is necessary, then, to define what should be done within a single cycle of the iteration and exactly what conditions should call a halt.  Recursion's fundamental property is that of self-reference: "In a recursive definition you define something in terms of itself (Wikström, 1987), and the context in which the students in the study met recursion was as a way of facilitating repetition, or an abstraction of iteration.  Such repetition is brought about by the defined function referring to itself, again until a suitable criterion, or base case, is met.  It should also be said that recursion is a notoriously difficult concept for students to make sense of, and a good deal of research has gone into identifying ways of simplifying it for the learner (Anderson, Pirolli & Farrell, 1988; Bhuiyan, Greer & MaCalla, 1991; Henderson & Romero, 1989).  The aim in this study, rather than finding better ways of presenting it, was to reveal how students were actually experiencing it, so that teachers could then exploit that insight (Booth, 1992a).

At some point in the interview, I asked the student to tell me about the ideas underlying recursion, from which a discussion ensued.  When their understanding of the fundamentals of recursion had been plumbed, and the discussion was revealing no new insights, they were presented with a simple text-book problem, of the kind they had been working on in practice classes, and asked what it meant.  Then they were asked to try to write a program to satisfy it.  As the program developed I asked for clarification of points that were puzzling, and when they could proceed no further I asked them to explain what their program, or part-program plus a simple correct program, would achieve.  As a result of analysing these interviews three qualitatively distinct conceptions of recursion were identified, reflecting the students' current total experience of recursion.  In Figure 2, these conceptions are summarised together with extracts from the interviews which typify the ways in which they were voiced.

Now, the teacher certainly sees recursion in all the ways described in these three conceptions.  It is indeed a construct in SML, it does indeed bring about repetition, and its fundamental characteristic is that it is self-referential.  The teacher can certainly handle it from any of these perspectives---and possibly from others as well.  But some of the students had not come beyond the first---the construct---at the time of this interview, when considerably more complex problems were being tackled in class.

This is an example of the teacher's understanding of the central notion of instruction being at odds with the ways many of the students were understanding it.  What is even more striking in this example of recursion is that students with no more developed understanding than that recursion is some way of writing programs in SML could actually produce correct and functioning programs---through recourse to memorised templates---while those who were struggling with more advanced ways of understanding were producing seriously flawed programs (Booth, 1992a).  Thus, written work, such as examination questions and lab exercises, gave no evidence of the poorest sort of understanding but plenty of evidence of more advanced forms of understanding which were incomplete but developing; students with undeveloped notions of recursion stood to succeed better in examinations than those who had come a bit further in their understanding.

Descriptions of the three conceptions of recursion identified here empower the teacher to address inconsistent or apparently nonsensical difficulties students have with recursion.  In particular, it offers a framework other than that of the discipline of computer science within which the teacher can consider recursion as an algorithmic construct in SML and identify what aspects of the total understanding are essential for adequate future development.

### Variation in Approaches to Writing Programs

In the program-writing exercises, I presented each student with a problem, asked them to read it and tell me what it was about, then asked them to try to write the necessary program.  As described above, one such problem involved recursion.  On the basis of the material thus collected, from the recursion problem and one other, I identified four qualitatively distinct approaches to writing programs.

A dichotomy corresponding to the deep and surface approaches can be seen, specifically referred to as Interpretative approaches and Opportunistic approaches, where "approach" relates primarily to the initial stages of the process, or more precisely, to the way in which the problem presents itself to the student.  Each of these is itself comprised of two distinctly different approaches, reflecting the fact that writing a program involves a to-ing and fro-ing between problem and program.  The interpretative pair are the *structural* approach, in which principal focus is on the structure of the problem in its own domain, and the *operational* approach where focus is more on what the program is going to have to do.  They are distinguished, and earn the tag "deep", by the attempt to make some sort of meaning out of the problem as it is presented.  The opportunistic (surface) pair comprise the *constructual* approach, where focus is on the constructs and elements, identified from the current repertoire, that might go to make up the required program, and the *expedient* approach, where existing programs are alighted on as the result of some clue in the problem, followed by an attempt to adapt it to the constraints of the problem.  The opportunistic approaches both focus on the goal of getting a program as solution, and not on finding meaning in the problem as it stands.  These approaches affect the whole program-writing process in that they indicate a limitation to the range of awareness of aspects of the task.  Figure 3 shows the structure of these approaches, in terms of theme and thematic field.

![Figure 3: The focus and range of the theme and thematic field in the developmental and solution-seeking approaches to writing programs](/Booth1997 figure 3.png)

The student who adopts a structural approach and looks for meaning in the problem, in the domain of the problem itself, opens his or her awareness to a wide range of potential themes and thematic fields.  In considering, for example, the structure of integers in a problem where one digit has to be extracted from a multi-digit number, a variety of properties of integers which could make possible starting points for the development of a suitable algorithm come to mind.  In particular, the fact that integers are written in base 10 leads to the realisation that dividing by 10 and handling the quotient and remainder in some way might be fruitful.  The student who knows something about computer construction might relate this to personal experience as well, in that registers which perform arithmetic make use of such algorithms in handling binary numbers.  This is lost to the student who takes, for example, the constructual approach, and leaps on the sort of constructs that have been recently learned ("after all, this is to do with practising what we have learned recently, isn't it?") and might be useful to effect a solution.  He, or she, takes a shot in the dark and tries to adapt the known constructs to the purposes of the problem to tinker together a working program.  The former student runs through a rich range of conceivable themes and thematic fields in the process of producing a program, while the latter delimits it from the outset.  (A more thorough argument to this effect, with recourse to greater detail of programming in the functional programming language SML, has been presented elsewhere, Booth, 1993a.)

Again, these four approaches can be seen either as reflecting the experience of the learners, as they indeed do, or as approaches to be found in the *profession* of computer science.  Much effort is put into designing programming languages and environments which specifically encourage an opportunistic approach to developing programs, in the name of efficiency through reusing well-written and well-understood code.  Thus, even the computer scientist as *teacher*, drawing on their scholarly disciplinary knowledge, might well laud, or encourage, the identifying of useful clues in a problem as a way of rapidly producing a working solution---that is their training.  But, on considering the ways in which the interpretative and opportunistic approaches can open or delimit the learner's awareness of the alternative aspects of the constructs of programming, and thereby open or delimit the bounds of learning, the teacher, drawing on their more appropriate didactic disciplinary knowledge, should realise that it is essential that students should take an interpretative approach to problems, and preferably interpret them in their own domains.

### Identifying Educationally Critical Aspects of Approach to Learning Tasks and Understanding of Content

It follows from the argument so far that there are educationally critically aspects of the content of learning to program, exemplified by the central concept of recursion, and of the tasks of learning to program, exemplified by writing programs to satisfy text-book problems.

In the case of recursion, and this particular course of instruction, it is essential that students should understand the *self-referential* nature of recursive algorithms.  This is because that is the kernel to understanding recursive algorithms in other programming languages such as LISP or Prolog, and to understanding recursive data-structures which are met in a later course on programming.  The teacher now has an analytical tool for determining not only the goal of instruction but also what aspects of a complete understanding might be looked for in evaluating the students' understanding.  Not only does he or she know that there is a potential spread of understanding of recursion, summarised in three qualitatively distinct conceptions, but also that the third of them is essential for future developments.  Forewarned that the production of working programs is no sign of an adequate understanding, the teacher can devise tasks that challenge such "template-programs".

The educationally critical aspect of learning to program through the common medium of writing programs in response to rather simple text-book problems is *interpretation*.  The student who interprets problems opens their programming awareness to a greater field of potential themes, sets off on a more fruitful track (Booth, 1993a) and even succeeds better in examinations (Booth, 1992b).  This puts the demand on the teacher, in the first place, to pose problems that allow interpretation, which is less obvious for some text-book writers than might be supposed.  In the second place, having taken the step to put problems embedded in contexts which students are encouraged to interpret, the teacher should be prepared to demonstrate such interpretation even when working in front of the class or in smaller groups.

### Revealing the Variation in Understanding and Approaches

Of course, the programming teacher cannot be expected to conduct, or finance, research into every aspect of their teaching.  The teacher who is alerted to the phenomenographic principles I have been elaborating can analyse the experience they have of students with difficulties to pin-point critical elements of understanding.  The main tool for revealing the variation of understanding and approach lies, however, as with Svensson and Högfors' (1988) physics students or the mathematics students of Järner *et al.* (1993), in providing the opportunity and the learning climate in which the variation comes to light as the result of focused student discussion.

It is not enough to ensure that laboratory exercises are done in pairs; observation shows that tight schedules lead to efficient division of labour, and that when two students meet at a computer terminal, discourse is minimal.  Tasks must be set which demand much more discussion in somewhat larger groups at all stages of work—interpretation of the problem (desirable in itself), planning the program, critiquing the product, debating the documentation. Such group discussion can lead to exchange of understandings and approaches where pair-work on problems that demand little or no collaboration do not.

### Transcending the Demands of the Task

Students come to their studies in computer science and computer engineering with some ambition to become computer professionals, and often with a background as hobbyists.  In the course which these results pertain to the examples given as tasks in lectures, exercise classes and practical exercises, as well as in the examinations, were all of the sort which are specified within the domain of programming or come from closely related areas of mathematics.  There was rather little attempt to locate the programs the students were developing in the normal areas of computer application.  This had much to do with the choice of the highly mathematical functional programming as first programming language and the choice of text-book which emphasised the mathematical foundations.

If the learning tasks of programming are to transcend the demands of the tasks in themselves, thereby locating the enterprise of learning to program in the sphere of the learner's own personal interest rather than in the sphere of pure education, more has to be done to embody the learning tasks in a variety of contexts.

### An Alternative Mode of Programming Instruction

The tradition mode of programming instruction, as seen in the course associated with this study, comprises: regular whole-class lectures in which new ideas are introduced, transmitted and developed, following the chosen text-book; regular exercise classes in smaller groups in which an assistant is initially available for help with a set of problems dealing with current topics, and later goes through them for the assembled group; and a small number of larger problems for which working programs have to be produced by pairs of students.  The new students spend part of the first seven weeks learning functional programming in this manner, with their experienced difficulties following something like an exponential curve: the first two weeks are very simple, focusing on arithmetic aspects of using the language, there follow two weeks in which simple algorithmic constructs are dealt with, while the fifth week introduces recursive algorithms, and the remaining two weeks are devoted to investigating more and more complex constructs and algorithms involving recursion.  As already mentioned, the problems that are set take their points of departure most commonly in program specifications, or in the domain of related mathematics, with only occasional glimpses of computer science applications.

The degree course has now been reformed, with one goal being to overcome the perceived shortcomings (an overriding goal is to encourage and support female students, who have hitherto been in a very small minority).  Students work in groups and thus there is greater room for discussion which can serve to reveal the variation of understanding and approach desired if the principles I am proposing are to be implemented.  While traditional subject boundaries are maintained, teachers have been collaborating on constructing common problems that can be illuminated from their respective disciplinary viewpoints.  The approach to teaching which has been embraced places greater emphasis on tackling problems prior to meeting theoretical expositions, thereby grounding the theory in some prior experience.  An introductory course is intended to induct the students into both the professional world of computer engineering and the world of their coming education, as well as provide an opportunity to explore the realm of computer science applications in society.  Here groups tackle a project in which contact with the world outside the university is essential, and which calls for and practises information and communication skills (Booth, Bayati & Petersson, 1996).  In that groups are of mixed background, and different groups take on different projects, the opportunity to extend the variety of context is also present, not only encouraging interpretation but also enabling the work put into the learning tasks the students engage in to transcend the tasks themselves and to enter the realm of personal interest on a wider scale.

The opportunities offered for incorporating the phenomenographically-inspired principles for teaching in such an initiative are obvious.  Courses which attempt to integrate subject matter demand that the teachers involved take a new look at their discipline-centred syllabuses.  Both the variation in ways of understanding key items of the course and the educationally critical aspects can profitably be considered in the meeting of two or more subject-teachers, with the corresponding meeting between different disciplinary perspectives.  There is more that could be done, for example, more of the teachers could be investigating how their students experience critical aspects of the subjects and how they actually go about their studies.

But the risks should not be ignored.  If problem-based or project-oriented courses are to result in learning which is superior to that attained in traditional instruction, it is essential that teachers should have a sustained commitment to the principles described here, and that their commitment infiltrates all aspects of their teaching.  It is not enough to put a course which has a large number of substantial problems in place and then let it run under its own steam.  The design of the content is important, but of equal importance is the design of the learning context.  The groups that are put to work on problems or projects should have the facilities for working together in a meaningful way and be discouraged from the traditional division of labour.  The introductory interpretation of the program and planning phases should be instituted as being at least as important as the production of a program and its documentation.  Discussion must not only be encouraged to take place, but it must also be focused on revealing and debating alternative ways of seeing and tackling the problem in question.  Even that is not enough if the debate fails to reach the attention of teachers and assistants, who should be building up and analysing their own experience of their students' experience.  Creating the atmosphere in which this can become the natural learning context is a demand on the creativity of the teachers second only to the transformation of their scholarly disciplinary knowledge to student-centred didactic disciplinary knowledge.
