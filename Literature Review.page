Learning Activities in Virtual Learning Environments
====================================================

Systems for Automated Assessment of Students' Code
==================================================

Automated code assessment tools have existed since
at least 1959. [Hollingsworth1960]().
The most salient benefits claimed are:

 -  they encourage students to reflect on
    whether their code really is correct,
    rather than doing just enough work to pass
    a few simple test cases and then moving on

 -  they make more efficient use of valuable
    teaching resources: in the earliest implementations,
    the bottleneck was the computer;
    later, it was the human assessor

 -  they allow more flexibility as to when the
    student attempts the exercise

 -  they can ease distance learning

However, some disadvantages were noted:

 -  faulty or malicious code may stop or subvert
    the automated assessment system

 -  assignments can only be set if
    a reliable set of unit tests can be devised
    to mark them

These days, sandboxing techniques -- from virtual
machines to hypervisors -- can prevent the "bad code"
problem.  The recognition of unit testing as a valuable
tool in industrial software development, including "Test
Driven Development", as well as enormous improvements in support
for code modularisation and abstraction,
means that many of these problems have been solved.

The Pedagogy of Computer Programming
====================================

Shallow vs. deep learners: different objects of learning; different representations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phenomonographical research investigates learners' approach to subject matter.
It often indicates that there are two broad approaches: *shallow* and *deep*.

Shallow learners only pay attention to the most salient features of the material,
and often miss the underlying structure.

Deep learners seek the deeper structure.
They look for alternative representations of the material,
in which other features are more salient.

Pedagogically, we should identify the important representations,
and give learners practice in translating between them
and selecting the most appropriate representation for the matter at hand.

This is especially important in computer programming,
because the essence of solving the problem is finding the appropriate representation
that makes the relevant features salient.
(This is the essence of Refactoring and Design Patterns.)

This difference between shallow and deep thinkers
may explain the bimodal distribution of performance
of beginning programming students,
and the observed characteristics of the two groups.

The Conversational Framework
----------------------------

Laurillard's notion of teaching is essentially rhetorical.
Of course, it would be great if students could go out and explore the subject entirely independently,
but time is limited, and there is an urgent need to get the students aligned with the necessary foundation materials.
However, Laurillard explicitly rejects the transmission model of teaching.
She prefers a rhetorical approach, in which the teacher brings the students round to a new relation with the world.
This is especially important for academic learning because, almost by definition,
academic knowledge is not accessible through direct experience.
It is a second-order experience of the world, which must be mediated through the teacher.

According to Laurillard, constructivism is old and busted[^problems-with-constructivism]
and phenomenography is the new hotness.

[^problems-with-constructivism]:
    Although constructivism has much to recommend it --
    especially its rejection of the transmission model of learning --
    it lacks the evidential basis required to make useful,
    student-centred prescriptions.

Phenomenography is a method of discovery (rather than hypothesis testing)
that produces qualitative data about categories of experience.
Pedagogically, phenomenography can show us:

 *  how students’ and teachers’ conceptions of the subject matter differ,
    and how we might make those conceptions explicit, so they may be usefully compared and contrasted

 *  the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful student–teacher–subject matter interactions

It does not -- indeed **cannot** -- show us how to present a particular conception to a student,
but it does suggest how teachers and students' conceptions can be made accessible to one another
and the differences highlighted.

Another important aspect is mapping between different representations of the same concepts.
For instance, it is often observed that students who can successfully answer quite difficult questions about Newtonian mechanics
still maintain distinctly Aristotelian intuitions.
This might be attributed to students' lack of practice
in mapping between the mathematical and their intuitive representations of the physical world.
