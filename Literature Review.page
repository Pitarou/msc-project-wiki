Learning Activities in Virtual Learning Environments
====================================================

Systems for Automated Assessment of Students' Code
==================================================

Automated code assessment tools have existed since
at least 1959. [Hollingsworth1960]().
The most salient benefits claimed are:

 -  they encourage students to reflect on
    whether their code really is correct,
    rather than doing just enough work to pass
    a few simple test cases and then moving on

 -  they make more efficient use of valuable
    teaching resources: in the earliest implementations,
    the bottleneck was the computer;
    later, it was the human assessor

 -  they allow more flexibility as to when the
    student attempts the exercise

 -  they can ease distance learning

However, some disadvantages were noted:

 -  faulty or malicious code may stop or subvert
    the automated assessment system

 -  assignments can only be set if
    a reliable set of unit tests can be devised
    to mark them

These days, sandboxing techniques -- from virtual
machines to hypervisors -- can prevent the "bad code"
problem.  The recognition of unit testing as a valuable
tool in industrial software development, including "Test
Driven Development", as well as enormous improvements in support
for code modularisation, means that many of these problems
have been solved. "Any problem can be solved with another
layer of abstraction."
