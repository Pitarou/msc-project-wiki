Reading Questions
=================

From my [Project Proposal](), the questions I will ask are:

1.  What pedagogical framework should guide my work?

2.  What needs should a programming proficiency assessment tool serve?

3.  What criteria and methods can we use to evaluate an assessment tool?

4.  What tools already exist? How well do they meet the needs and
    criteria I have identified? What can I learn from them?

5.  What needs are not being met by the currently available tools?

6.  Can these needs be met by extending or modifying the available
    tools, or is it necessary to build something new?
