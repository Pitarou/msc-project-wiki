Todo List
=========

  * ~~Make sure the github and local wikis are kept in sync~~

  * ~~Host this wiki on github~~

  * Try to get the Markdown -> .pdf toolchain working with the document at [Project Proposal]()

  * ~~Find publisher details for *The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume II* (<http://www.aosabook.org>)~~
    
    It's self-published at <http://lulu.com>.

  * Questions arising from [Hunt2012b]():
    + Is it still the case that only activity modules can have sub-plugins?
    + Are they still using the old, unmaintained forms library?
    + Any progress on the database foreign keys issue?
    + find out about "the interesting content-addressed way that Moodle stores uploaded files"

  * ~~Decide whether I'll need to apply for ethical approval~~ I won't.

  * ~~What is the default value for `upload_tmp_dir`?~~

    I think it's `$TMPDIR`, which is currently `/var/folders/k1/nbxdvf9d4zd4t8hscg_6cb3m0000gn/T/`

  * ~~Look into what functionality I'm losing if the php `intl` module is not installed.~~

    I'm losing unicode and localisation support.
