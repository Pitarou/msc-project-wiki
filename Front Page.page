Todo List
=========

 *  ~~Make sure the github and local wikis are kept in sync~~

 *  ~~Host this wiki on github~~

 *  Try to get the Markdown -> .pdf toolchain working with the document at [Project Proposal]()

 *  ~~Find publisher details for *The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume II* (<http://www.aosabook.org>)~~
    
    It's self-published at <http://lulu.com>.

 *  Questions arising from [Hunt2012b]():
    + Is it still the case that only activity modules can have sub-plugins?
    + Are they still using the old, unmaintained forms library?
    + Any progress on the database foreign keys issue?
    + find out about "the interesting content-addressed way that Moodle stores uploaded files"

 *  ~~Decide whether I'll need to apply for ethical approval~~ I won't.

 *  ~~What is the default value for `upload_tmp_dir`?~~

    I think it's `$TMPDIR`, which is currently `/var/folders/k1/nbxdvf9d4zd4t8hscg_6cb3m0000gn/T/`

 *  ~~Look into what functionality I'm losing if the php `intl` module is not installed.~~

    I'm losing unicode and localisation support.

 *  Finish moodle installation:
     +  [Install `intl` package](http://darraghenright.tumblr.com/post/22027208929/installing-intl-package-on-osx-lion)
     +  ~~[Set up virtual hosting](Installing Moodle on my Mac#creating-virtual-hosts)~~
     +  [smtp settings](http://localhost/~peter/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=messagesettingemail)
     +  [system paths](http://localhost/~peter/moodle/admin/settings.php?section=systempaths)
     +  [update time zone information](http://localhost/~peter/moodle/admin/tool/timezoneimport/index.php)
     +  [Configure cron](http://docs.moodle.com/25/en/Cron)
     +  [Create a test user](http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Add_a_new_user)
     +  [Send them a message](http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/message)
     +  [Create a course](http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Adding_a_new_course)

 *  Look into these references in [Britain2004]():
     + The **conversational framework** (Laurillard, 1993)
     + the **Viable System Model** (VSM) (e.g. Beer 1979, 1981, 1985)

 *  ~~Grab picture of the diagram of the conversational framework on
    page 24 of [Britain2004]().~~
