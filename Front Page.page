Todo List
=========

  * ~~Make sure the github and local wikis are kept in sync~~

  * ~~Host this wiki on github~~

  * Try to get the Markdown -> .pdf toolchain working with the document at [Project Proposal]()

  * Find publisher details for *The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume II* (<http://www.aosabook.org>)

  * Questions arising from [Hunt2012b]():
    + Is it still the case that only activity modules can have sub-plugins?
    + Are they still using the old, unmaintained forms library?
    + Any progress on the database foreign keys issue?
    + find out about "the interesting content-addressed way that Moodle stores uploaded files"

  * Decide whether I'll need to apply for ethical approval
